# "Against" Marxism, the pinnacle of academic obscurantism

There is not a journal dedicated to how you, specifically, you, your personal being, should live your life. There is no formal (academic) school of philosophy that really deals with this topic. Instead, you see all the manosphere, or feminist, or parentally preached content. There is a dire need for everyone that lives, a need that is immediate, a need that begins when he ever starts thinking about his life. Admit it, just admit it. The academia is impenetrable to the commoners, especially the wageslaves (or will-bes), the people who can not afford time. This void, is then filled with various cultists, such as the nationalists, the religious preachers, the parents, the mass media, which serve as an excellent proof that the void exists, that the need is so dire. 

Am I against Marxism? This is off-topic. 

Marxists tell you to read their books and cite elaborate details. Christians do very much the same, as if they want to show off their rich memory of theology. They continue to talk as if everyone agrees with their entire glossary of definitions, acting surprised when you attempt to question their defintions.

I'd term what I hereby advocate, as practical philosophy, or better, _immediate philosophy_. What is immediate philosophy is what is immediately understandable, useful, truthful, loyal, to you, your own needs and goals. 

## What if the commoners should be deceived

I even advocate for a deception of the self, _suspension of doubt_, or some call it a *leap of faith*.

Deception is surprisingly common and necessary. The causal argument for that is many things we deem good end up having deception, a necessary premise.

Deception is not all equal. Here I apply a reasoning tactic I often use, the _assumption of non-identity_, a tactic that belongs to reasoning about ontology. We may use the same word 'deception' (and in the same meaning) in many contexts. Then almost driven by momentum, we try to apply our belief such as 'authenticity is good' sweepingly. 

I call this method, _philosophy of nuance_. I value direct observation, direct theorizing, and coining your own terms. 

The worst thing about a *leap of faith*, is that it's often impossible for the obsessive reasoners. Then ultimately the leap is only possible with some sort of external circumstances, which are all a form of coercion.

Here, I used another tactic, the separation of a theory and its effect/usage/feasibility. I argue that a theory that urges people to do anything, must not be separated from its effect. The blame it receives when it fails to work, is equally applicable to the theory itself. 

## Live in a world of higher narrative framework

I see emotions, pains, happiness, as a form of violence. I have tried to conceptualize them again and again. I worked around them. Only their effects can be conceptualized.

All forms of philosophy so far value well-being, which ultimately, inevitably lands in sensory well-being. I don't use happiness, or pleasure, since they would have caused confusion. 

The very observation that all philosophies point to the same thing, and not just popular cultures, is in some way horrifying in itself. It would be absurd to not pursue well being, as the end of all means, as the ultimate end that is "self-justified", but per _Hume_, we can not derive _outght_ from _is_. The ought to well-being is a form of violence. A violence that is forced upon humans beings of the time.

Human beings are forced to live in the moment, surrounded by the dialogue with others, the monologue, the immediate urges, passions and emotions. Occasionally a person may think of 'nihilism' of some sort, or immerse in a grandiose wholistic worldview from a novel. The violence pulls you back. 

The immediate narrative which a person often lives in, is poorly logical, fragmented. 

## Retro-metacognition, when you discover hidden beliefs

Hedonists live a life, often without the awareness that they believe 'hedonism is to be valued' implicitly. The implication is revealed when we step back from ourselves and observe our own behavior from the outside. What is most convincing is the case when I discover my past but hidden beliefs myself. 

I live in the fear of implied beliefs. They could drive major decisions and what is hidden is assumed and most dangerous.


# The Scream of Outliers

> Tribute to Kafka.

- The overwhelming policies based on overacrhing conceptions, generalizations.
- The lack of nuance in institutions
- The attack of institutions themselves
- The laziness of institutions, their voter base, the masses
- The ubiquity of outliers
- The violence against outliers
- The outliers are the minority of minority. 
- The outliers upset the status quo. 
- The outliers wreck apart the common morality with their bizarre experiences in life. 
- The outliers are not vocal. They are, Kafkaesque. 
- The minority is vocal. The minority is drama.
- The outliers are neverending. For any bold claim about a generalization you want to make, the outliers exist, and they are defiant. They wreck your logic apart.  
- The hypocrisy of all of that.
- The minority gains recognition, and become the norm itself. They enjoy the privilege, become entitled, and get utterly surprised when a pushback happens. The outliers, however, are never ending. 
- The outliers are a manifest of dialectic itself, and humans shall, reason, and accept the process. 
- The one person who betrayed his own race
- The one person who betrayed his own gender
- The one person who betrayed his own 'queer community'
- The outlier continues.  
- I am affiliated with nothing. 

There has always been a strange feeling in countless encounters in my life, the moment I was misunderstood, the moment when I was left alone, estranged. The feeling stayed through my life until I gradually started to put it into words. There is not a single instance of such feeling, or situation that is worth noting down here. Nor is it worth sharing with others, because they are doomed to be not understood, *Kafkaesque*. I always believed, however, the true answer to human compassion is through reason, not emotions, with the all-encompassing sweeping generalizations. 

The concept of pain was a good one, capturing a huge range of negative feelings. Then, here comes the *estrangement*, or being an outlier, which I use due to its mathematical undertone. The *estrangement* is perhaps even worse than pain, which is perhaps just dull and bland. 

Modern society has harnessed reason as a tool of ruling. Reason, as defined by governments. Reason is defined to be a set of barely changing laws. Reason is defined to be a set of institutions. Reason is upheld and justified. The law applies its "reason" equally tolerating no exceptions or outliers. 

The communists have tried. They established a new dictatorship. They executed the rich, tolerating no outliers. The racists tried, setting up concentration camps, shutting down immigration. What is truly wrong with humans. Is the problem, a class struggle, a racial struggle, or, just the struggle of outliers?

Praise the outlier. The one Chinese who goes against his own race with critique hasher than outsiders. The one man who is different from the norm of his gender. And most importantly how he then goes agaisnt the norm of "the queer community" he used to, or you think he would, belong to.

The outliers may become regonized, occasionally, rising to the status of "the minority". They stopped being outliers the moment that happens. Yet, the outliers continue to exist. You become the outlier when you disagree with "the minority". There is never any recognition of the outlier in the current way the society think about things, because the minority is recognized due to their political status, not as an inherent element of thought. 

Outliers have no homeland. Nor are outliers affilated with anything. Just as how absurd and crudely rational the modern conception of nation-states and borders are. 

The iron law of markets penalize the outliers, 

## The masses adapt their morals when the outliers are in power

- The innovators are outliers. 
- The rich are outliers. They do not obey the rules. 
- The history is shaped by outliers. (not workers) 
- The masses always want to shame the outliers because they don't obey a norm, yet the rich oppress them.
- The masses preach property laws yet the outliers rig the markets. They see it as just. 

## The majority deserve the treatment

Outliers exist? Does that mean we ought to abandon our fruitful constructs of reason over categories, or in other words, the immensely useful generalizations? No, never.

History has made two biggest mistakes, the grave generalization committed by fascists and communists, with their overwhelming mass movements. The other mistake is a total renunciation of generalizations, in favor of a reckless equality.

The majority deserve their treatment. The outliers are their own breed. 

## Kafka's socialism

- The eros are fragile (against modern hedonism)
- The collective is opppressive and alienating.
- The absurd and unexpected is endless in every corner. (against wholistic design)
- The absurd must be extinguished with human power
- The exact means to such socialism is left to readers. 

The socialism of last century was Kafkaesque. The next one shouldnt be.
