# "Against" Marxism, the pinnacle of academic obscurantism

There is not a journal dedicated to how you, specifically, you, your personal being, should live your life. There is no formal (academic) school of philosophy that really deals with this topic. Instead, you see all the manosphere, or feminist, or parentally preached content. There is a dire need for everyone that lives, a need that is immediate, a need that begins when he ever starts thinking about his life. Admit it, just admit it. The academia is impenetrable to the commoners, especially the wageslaves (or will-bes), the people who can not afford time. This void, is then filled with various cultists, such as the nationalists, the religious preachers, the parents, the mass media, which serve as an excellent proof that the void exists, that the need is so dire. 

Am I against Marxism? This is off-topic. 

Marxists tell you to read their books and cite elaborate details. Christians do very much the same, as if they want to show off their rich memory of theology. They continue to talk as if everyone agrees with their entire glossary of definitions, acting surprised when you attempt to question their defintions.

I'd term what I hereby advocate, as practical philosophy, or better, _immediate philosophy_. What is immediate philosophy is what is immediately understandable, useful, truthful, loyal, to you, your own needs and goals. 

## What if the commoners should be deceived

I even advocate for a deception of the self, _suspension of doubt_, or some call it a *leap of faith*.

Deception is surprisingly common and necessary. The causal argument for that is many things we deem good end up having deception, a necessary premise.

Deception is not all equal. Here I apply a reasoning tactic I often use, the _assumption of non-identity_, a tactic that belongs to reasoning about ontology. We may use the same word 'deception' (and in the same meaning) in many contexts. Then almost driven by momentum, we try to apply our belief such as 'authenticity is good' sweepingly. 

I call this method, _philosophy of nuance_. I value direct observation, direct theorizing, and coining your own terms. 

The worst thing about a *leap of faith*, is that it's often impossible for the obsessive reasoners. Then ultimately the leap is only possible with some sort of external circumstances, which are all a form of coercion.

Here, I used another tactic, the separation of a theory and its effect/usage/feasibility. I argue that a theory that urges people to do anything, must not be separated from its effect. The blame it receives when it fails to work, is equally applicable to the theory itself. 

## Live in a world of higher narrative framework

I see emotions, pains, happiness, as a form of violence. I have tried to conceptualize them again and again. I worked around them. Only their effects can be conceptualized.

All forms of philosophy so far value well-being, which ultimately, inevitably lands in sensory well-being. I don't use happiness, or pleasure, since they would have caused confusion. 

The very observation that all philosophies point to the same thing, and not just popular cultures, is in some way horrifying in itself. It would be absurd to not pursue well being, as the end of all means, as the ultimate end that is "self-justified", but per _Hume_, we can not derive _outght_ from _is_. The ought to well-being is a form of violence. A violence that is forced upon humans beings of the time.

Human beings are forced to live in the moment, surrounded by the dialogue with others, the monologue, the immediate urges, passions and emotions. Occasionally a person may think of 'nihilism' of some sort, or immerse in a grandiose wholistic worldview from a novel. The violence pulls you back. 

The immediate narrative which a person often lives in, is poorly logical, fragmented. 

## Retro-metacognition, when you discover hidden beliefs

Hedonists live a life, often without the awareness that they believe 'hedonism is to be valued' implicitly. The implication is revealed when we step back from ourselves and observe our own behavior from the outside. What is most convincing is the case when I discover my past but hidden beliefs myself. 

I live in the fear of implied beliefs. They could drive major decisions and what is hidden is assumed and most dangerous.


# The Scream of Outliers

> Tribute to Kafka.

There has always been a strange feeling in countless encounters in my life, the moment I was misunderstood, the moment when I was left alone, estranged. The feeling stayed through my life until I gradually started to put it into words. There is not a single instance of such feeling, or situation that is worth noting down here. Nor is it worth sharing with others, because they are doomed to be not understood, *Kafkaesque*. I always believed, however, the true answer to human compassion is through reason, not emotions, with the all-encompassing sweeping generalizations. 

The concept of pain was a good one, capturing a huge range of negative feelings. Then, here comes the *estrangement*, or being an outlier, which I use due to its mathematical undertone. The *estrangement* is perhaps even worse than pain, which is perhaps just dull and bland. 

Modern society has harnessed reason as a tool of ruling. Reason, as defined by governments. Reason is defined to be a set of barely changing laws. Reason is defined to be a set of institutions. Reason is upheld and justified. The law applies its "reason" equally tolerating no exceptions or outliers. 

The communists have tried. They established a new dictatorship. They executed the rich, tolerating no outliers. The racists tried, setting up concentration camps, shutting down immigration. What is truly wrong with humans. Is the problem, a class struggle, a racial struggle, or, just the struggle of outliers?

Praise the outlier. The one Chinese who goes against his own race with critique hasher than outsiders. The one man who is different from the norm of his gender. And most importantly how he then goes agaisnt the norm of "the queer community" he used to, or you think he would, belong to.

The outliers may become regonized, occasionally, rising to the status of "the minority". They stopped being outliers the moment that happens. Yet, the outliers continue to exist. You become the outlier when you disagree with "the minority". There is never any recognition of the outlier in the current way the society think about things, because the minority is recognized due to their political status, not as an inherent element of thought.

The dialectic is almost shaped by a constant _betrayals_ of communities. 

- I betrayed my own race or nation, marked by the sharp criticism which many of the nationals see me as dissident.
- I betrayed various online communities such as those who shared my same criticism of the nation and race, due to differing views.
- I betrayed 'queer communities' or things of this kind that I do not want to name more. 

The outliers shall not fear betraying communities. They stand with nothing but the dialectic motion itself, whom I consider a physical embodiment of the dialectics. The problem with many current problems in politics is the problem of minority. The current social-dynamics can not handle a constant movement of thought process, or in other words, the consensus moves too slowly to follow the dialectic. Despite that I find the idea of 'minority' and 'legistlating laws to protect them or such regular legal process' an orthogonal solution to the very problem. People are often educated to recognize the minority, but not the constant existence of different kinds of outliers.  

Outliers have no homeland. Nor are outliers affilated with anything. Just as how absurd and crudely rational the modern conception of nation-states and borders are. The mechanism of market is not that different from the institutions of state, regarding to its treatment of outliers.

## The masses adapt their morals when the outliers are in power

- The innovators are outliers. 
- The rich are outliers. They do not obey the rules. 
- The history is shaped by outliers. (not workers) 
- The masses always want to shame the outliers because they don't obey a norm, yet the rich oppress them.
- The masses preach property laws yet the outliers rig the markets. They see it as just. 

There is always exception to rules which the masses constantly follow and many genuinely believe in the justness that they are forced to follow the rules. Rules however, always come with exceptions, the regulators themselves, and the rich. The masses turn a blind eye to such facts. I have met some communists online and they seem to believe in a revolution by the masses, for which I later found some excellent rebuttals. 

Identify the causally important elements towards a causal goal, effect or consequence. The history is always shaped by outliers. If there are mass movements, it's usually initiated by a few people, or sparks of thoughts from a few people. It would be massively fallacious to attribute the change to the masses. Innovators are, by tautology, outliers.  

## The majority deserve the treatment

Outliers exist? Does that mean we ought to abandon our fruitful constructs of reason over categories, or in other words, the immensely useful generalizations? No, never.

History has made two biggest mistakes, the grave generalization committed by fascists and communists, with their overwhelming mass movements. The other mistake is a total renunciation of generalizations, in favor of a reckless equality.

The majority deserve their treatment. The outliers are their own breed. 

## Kafka's socialism

- The eros are fragile (against modern hedonism)
- The collective is opppressive and alienating.
- The absurd and unexpected is endless in every corner. (against wholistic design)
- The absurd must be extinguished with human power
- The exact means to such socialism is left to readers. 

The socialism of last century was Kafkaesque. The next one shouldnt be. 

It's then imperative to think what should this whole theory of Kafkaism land in. The various ideologies of past century have been dealing with class struggle, production, races, various aspirations. Imminent development in the future can drastically change the goals we want to pursue. I'd want to anchor the thought onto something that will probably, persist into foreseeable future for a quite a long time. That the very goal of next socialism should target the problem of _Kafkaesque predicatement_ of individuals itself. 

Is socialism just about bread, or the production of material goods, or the triumph of a society maybe of some specific race? All of them will eventually fall into some sort of Kafkaesque dystopia in various corners unseen in the official propaganda. Think this idea as a pointer that points far into future, rather a specific prescription of the blueprint of a future socialism.

# Dialectics and classical logic

I've my own way of estimating my worth of thoughts. I value it when a new idea of mine challenges, or contradicts most mainstream thoughts. Such contradiction is based on ample contemplation of existing arguments, thus, a dialectical development. 

I had been having a very rich dialectical experience unaware, due to my posession of an internal monologue, which I found to be non existent for many people, later. The intuitive experience is like bumping back and forth across views, and each past view is a _dialectical step_, or _dialectic intermediate_. The term doesn't matter. On a tangent, I love expressing my thoughts with new terms each time, to show off that I actually understand them unlike many organic LLMs that live on the internet, and in my city.

This view, a temporal, longitudinal view of progression of ideas, such as your own understanding of some particular thing, casts a shadow on every moment of my thinking, because I know they are dialectic intermediates, incomplete, imperfect. 

This may sound like truism. I agreed so too, until I became very explicitly aware of such a process. The depiction of it as a truism, is also drawn as parallel to a thought that was traditional in Chinese culture. [Lu Xun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Xun) called it 中庸的，调和的 which shares great similarity to the laymen interpretation of dialectics. The dialectics taught in Chinese universities is false too. 

> Every thought is a bit right, and every thought is a bit wrong. Truism, platitude?

There is no useful knowledge that can be drawn from this sentence, without knowing the full theory of dialectics. It may serve some useless skepticism and as a weapon in bad-faith debates, though. 

I used the state-machine model a lot. The benefit of drawing compsci concepts is that they are easy to communicate, and usually non ambiguous.

Dialectic logic is like the whole state machine, with the axis of time included, while classical logic, deals with every snapshot, ie, every state. 

To understand classical logic, I recommend a tour through the tutorials of [Lean4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4). Don't be scared of theorem provers like I was. They are really just, theorem, provers.

Lean4 captures the entirety of classical logic, with its powerful type system.

1. Classical logic does not care what the terms mean
2. Classical logic is a language
3. Classical logic is closed, hermetic, and does not care about its 'external world'

This is my definition of classical logic, or, if it differs from mainstream definition, this is what I believe it should mean. 

When you reason through classical logic, the system is based off a fixed set of axioms, and all conclusions, facts drawn are enclosed within this system. All terms are well-defined to be a fixed place within the system. You can even feed the whole system into a machine to check for correctness of a proof, which does not understand the terms like a human. 

1. Terms do not need to have a semantic meaning
2. Terms have fixed, non ambiguous meanings within the system, for this definition of _meaning_.
3. Temrs do not need to correspond to reality. ie, it does not need to deal the problems implicated in _corrspondance theory of truth_

The entire modern STEM is based on classical logic. 

When you reason through, alone or with an interlocutor, using dialectics, the terms are refined, changed, throughout the discourse. That does not mean we can not have stable definitions of terms. It is rather what we want through such a discourse, to gain a better understanding, attached to symbols. 

Definitions are absolutely stable regarding numbers, for example, _within the system of calculus_. You might argue against saying how much thoughts appear when you think of numbers and new thoughts arise etc, but, well, I am specifically referring the idea of numbers, _within its system of calculus_.  `Idea(numbers as a general idea) ∩ Idea(the number's calculus)`


# The dialectic imperative

There are notable ideas that can be drawn from dialectics. 

Such as that I can define reason to be a continual dialectical progression. 

A moral duty to dialectically progress one's thought. 

Civil covenants based on dialectics instead of simply 'free speech', and fixed contracts of 'private property'. 

In light of Kafka's thought, I think dialectics is the perfect response. Each possible Kafkaesque situation is a thought awaiting to be integrated into the dialectic machine. The estrangement is exactly what happens when the rest of society do not try to consider the bizarre situation someone is going through.

The _correct_ worldview should maximally integrate thoughts into the dialectic-state-machine where each of them meaningfully push the whole understanding forward, intuitively, a greater picture. By thoughts I mean all the possible future scenarios, all the possible past scenarios, no matter how bizarre; all possible ideas, no matter how forbidden they are, how much they upset you, how counter intuitive they seem.

# Algebraic theory of politics

To algebra, means to abstract out details. That's not all. It's the matter of building a theory based on a foundation of abstractions, which is typically seen in abstract algebra. 

To build a good algebraic theory, it needs a good pick of fundamental elements. And to justify such algebraic theories, I refer to the above elaboration about how both classical logic and dialectics coexist and stay true. 

An algebraic theory is based on a set of abstract elements, which correspond to axioms in classical logic. That is to say, an algebraic theory is hermetic, closed, and perpetual. An algebraic theory should avoid referencing things in real world without explicit awareness, such that the theory forms a coherent language that does not need to deal with language-reality correspondence. 

## Intentionality and mechanisms

There are only 2 elements that participate in a political system, the intentionality, and the mechanisms that follow various sources of intentionality due to their subservient nature. This forms the basis of my radically different view on politics.

Market is defined by a vector of wealth over all individuals, where the ranks of power are determined by their relative wealth, which is simplest among all systems, in isolation. In comparison to this view of politics, the various political ideologies are somewhat obfuscating the nature of political dynamics. There is, for example, no inherently evil market because market is subservient to the combination of legal regulation and the investors the customers, both are sources of intentionality, which can be directly derived from this theory. This is therefore the 1st point that can be derived to refute a common view that market is inherently evil or some simply call it capitalistic, or phrased in more vague ways.

This framework can be very useful in analyzing immediate problems that exist today, at least. Consider all the systems that may be designed, it's logically inevitable within each one there are sources of intentionality and a massive amount of mechanisms where people have to follow a certain pattern of behavior. Then, it's only relevant to have better sources of intentionality in these systems. 

Do sources of intentionality have anything to do with particular mechanisms such as markets or planning? They don't. 

> I will call sources of intentionality as intention origins from now on

Consider an existing system with bad intention origins, how do you expect good behaving (such as morally good) intention origins to arise? The corrupt people in power would prevent that, _by tautology_. It's therefore a prerequisite that a system have benign intention origins, rather than what most current political theoriests try to do, ie, endlessly analyzing mechanisms and consider politics to be a science of mechanisms, ignoring the persistance, and precedence, the causal importance of intention origins. 

## Abstract algebra of power, politics

> Politics and economy

Following the method of abstract algebra, lets define some axiomatic elements of the algebra

- Absolute Money, as a form of power that has no strings attached.
- Will, any kind of intention that is powerless without money.
    - There is conflict, between wills.
- Absolute violence is conceptualized as an extreme form of power where the outcome of event _A_ is forcefully made by some will against other will. 
    - The violence can come from nature, state, or regular people.
    - Money is a stateful construct upon this notion, which faciliates the theory.
- Willed Money. Role powers in institutions, legal powers, academic, corporate credentials, status. The acquirement of such money and exercising their power requires conformity to a specific will. 
    - Legal money, which is a common form of willed money, close enough to absolute money, but mainly subject to taxation and various fees.
    - Property is what a free will can dispose of, with total sovereignty.
        - Asset is a form of property that generates money, where in its purest form, pure asset. Pure asset generates money without the owner conforming to any other will such as in the way of labouring.
        - Inalienable property, those things that are tied to free will, for all practical purposes, such as looks and intellect, which can not be directly traded yet.
- Gains, defined as a function over a particular will. Absolute money produces equal, net gains for every free will, by tautology. This gives absolute money a special conceptual status of _pure utility_
- Loss is defined as negative gains. 

The willed money, is hence, a 'linear combination' of the former two algebraic constructs. 

Under this framework, only the net profit of a corporate, or disposable income of a person can count as 'legal money', as the rest of money is subject to will of clients, not of their own, having strings attached.

The modern system has a vast collection of willed money, each serving a different goal. 

Out of all kinds of willed money, legal money, aka currency, is most liquid, easily tradeded due to their structural simplicity. Different kinds of money are interexchanged which is enabled by a matter of configuration of current reality.

Being algebraic abstracts out specific details, which makes it last longer regarding the rapidly shifting landscape, as a good political theory should deal with. The theory should last into future despite rapid development in AI. Most other political theories of current time focus on specifics of morality, methods of social organization, production or rebellion. 

The algebraic method in general also tries to capture the whole of reality, as in phenomena, top-down, which is total rationalization in best effort, as in, not missing any part in the theory. 

## Origin of power

> This section is getting bloated. TODO

I was requested to clarify the concept of property. It would be a better way to put it from how power even originated. 

In primordial times, around the time agentic consciousness began, we consider of the course of events to follow a trajectory of nature, which is often called arbitrary, random. Diving deeper into the notion it's really just a lack of some intelligent being exerting its control onto reality. The idea and the definition of 'arbitrariness of nature' is really, in this perspective a lack of conscious control by anybody.

The origin of power starts from _property_. I don't mean property by what it means in the huge interlaced network of political fabrication of the time. _Property_ here means, when a person holds exclusive control over a land, perhaps thousands of years ago. Property does not refer to the land, _but_ the power to maintain an exclusive access, the power to shape the future course of trajectory of events happening on the land. Hence, the notion is tightly bound to the idea of causality itself, conferring generality.

The algebraic part about the theory is that we begin conceptualization from this point of tether, building more complex notions up in the hierarchy gradually, while staying contained in the algebraic framework without introducing more fundamental concepts.

_Legal property_ is a delegated form of property, where the power over property is exercised through a third-party, the state. We don't argue what really counts as the term 'property' either, because the term is just symbol that only has a meaning in a specific context, where the meaning itself is defined by its context for sake of reasoning.

Labour is property, because it effectively reshapes the local reality over matters of material until it becomes some usable product. Using this definition, bureaucratic power itself is also property, trivially, stemming from state power. 

The realm a property can cover is often narrow. State has power over beings, but the state itself does not have power over reality. It's a transaction where beings conform to the state in exchange of other matters of value. 

The notion of currency is constructed due to the ubiquitous exchange of property. Property represents a stationary form of power exerted by beings over a narrow domain, and currency is a token that beings value.

Humans can not morph their bodies arbitarily yet, even with the total effort of civilzation. Currency is a token within the state, therefore has its power bounded by the upper bound of what the state can do.

> What does it mean when a being can get free currency without providing any labour?

Wait, I don't speak words like 'exploitation' or such things at this point. I'm here only to examine the causal network of matter itself. 

I call the totality of human control over reality _the state_, which as as an apparatus, a system, exerts its power through various governments and mechanisms of economy to have beings labour over reality.

Having free currency without having one's own free will obstructed, by tautology, means to have pure power over reality, through the labour of others. It's still not a state of total free will because the state forbids any violation of property typically. Power nowadays are often measured by currencies. That might not accurately reflect the power in question.

I re-read my the previous section. I was reasoning more about those things that serve as tokens that beings value, which diverges from this section. Valuing as a belief and an act. Power fundamentally is grounded in the trajectory of reality. There is no power without agents conforming to the tokens.

I think the property system probably causes a bias in reasoning. Things get measured in matter of currency and people start using currency as a measure of value. I like my causality perspective on property. If you have ability to nudge the outcome of a specific event, you are said to have control, and the substance by which you exert control is called property. The substance can be money, others recognition of you as a relevant person in their connections, and your labour. 

# Null hypothesis on the nature of conscious identity 

There is a stance that I have been having that is analogous to the null hypothesis, but applied in the realm of _personal philosophy_, as in the philosphy of dealing with one's own outlook on life and personal identity. 

The null stance simply states that, nothing other than the consciouness itself is assumed to be part of the self, yourself, or myself. That none of the surroundings, be it my race, the assignment the parents I got, my nation, is assumed, is taken for granted. It's simply absurd to me to assume that the things are a part of myself for no apparent reason, which underpins a vast array of modern ideologies. They assume too much about their identity, yet most elements about their identity is arbitrary, randomly chosen at birth. 

I only found out the need to write this down because it turned out this is not an idea that many share with me, as opposed to what I previously assumed.

This section should answer my view on race, nation, and identity _in totality_

# Wisdom and intellect

I take a computer science approach to explain the difference between wisdom, and intellect. 

Consider a function `Sha256(x)=y`, wisdom is the knowledge of `x`, while intellect, is the ability to reverse the function. 

Apparently in this case it's computationally impossible. This is more on the side of immediate knowledge or information, so, extrapolate `x` to be a some specific way of thinking, specific habits of dealing with things, specific configuration of assumptions (mindset) before any more information is available, a specific worldview. 

It's therefore possible for a computationally inferior agent to _outwit_ a more computationally powerful agent through the _wisdom_, which in the above case, is taken to extreme. Substitute _outwit_ with _outcompete_ in other aspects such as achieving certain noble goals if you need.

Getting substantially more intellect is generally impossible for a human being, but wisdom is not bounded. 

In the causal path to truth-seeking, there are the only two elements, information and compute. Saying that also implies there is a substantial element of information, which enables low-compute agents to massively outpace superior agents with the help of good information. Good information can be, knowledge of a better algorithm, which may reduce complexity from `O(n^2)` to `O(logn)`, while compute is close to average for most human beings by tautology.

This is also, how the right prompt can make LLMs 'much smarter' because we are giving it some 'knowledge' that is on a very high metacognitive level. In an analogy, the AI was running on a `O(n)` algorithm and the prompt we gave them is some sort of `O(logn)` method of thought.

# Pareto front, multi variate, multi objective optimization

I have to name this method of thought, as in, it as a gadget that I often pick up to frame my ideas, to analyze things, the notion of Pareto front, a recurring theme throughout my recent stream of thought.

Then going meta again, it's sometimes more preferable to write down _gadgets of thoughts_, rather than try to come up with gigantic, systematic theoretical works.

Many problems of real world are often over-simplified, such as the concern on privacy, the advocate of privacy. Many would want a single piece of software that is specialized in protecting the user's privacy, yet the problem itself is actually a multi-objective optimization over _actual usability_ and _privacy_. Speaking of usability, I would, as usual, ground it in very immediate phenomena, that the user actually makes friends through a privacy-enhanced device, or software, or platform, that the solution in question is actually increasing the rate of the usability, which is the _phenonemal account of usability_. This can be said for many other problems that most of them are multi-objective optimization, instead of what they seem to be single-objective which many assume so.

# Dialectical freedom, as opposed to constitutional free speech or paradox of tolerance

There is a practical and dire need for a better idea that is drafted to substitute for constitutional free speech or paradox of tolerance, be it a mode of moderation in a small community, or society at large. Not like I really count on this to be implemented, but it's the idea I would propose if there needs to be one, at all. 

The "or" in the section title does not imply a parallelism. Speaking of their parallelism, it lies in the fact that they are both being pushed, thus constituting my use of "or".

On a tangent, there are infinitely many ideas being pushed. For each one of the idea, I suggest a dichotomal split, as a starting point of thought, that an idea is not just an idea in public, but the _idea de jure_ and the _idea in effect_. It would be utterly fallacious to just treat the idea as they are pushed, much as I do not just take what a person says, I observe what he does.

The idea of free speech always falls short when it gets implemented in online communities, because there is an infinitude of nuance that is not captured in a simple code of 'free speech'. The particularities remain non-rationalized and people mostly only focus on that simple _code_ or _covenant_ of free speech.

The matter is to treat politics and social system as a whole, as a conversation, a dialogue, a rational process. 

Analogously to free speech, we can forbid what blocks the dialectical progress, and intentionally promote what drives the dialectic forward. In practicse this is very similar to what 'code of free speech' will effect in. 

- Spam (valid under free speech, invalid under dialectical freedom as it blocks reasoning)
- Slurs (valid under free speech, invalid under certain code of tolerance, valid under dialectical freedom as long as its not spam)
- Violence (blocks dialectical progress)
- Property (blocks dialectical progress as it blocks the liberty of people who can effect change)

# Retrospective chronological view on life

I have tried to rationalize my past which does provided me with useful insights, including, personality development analyzed from the whole trajectory of life.

Here is another thing first. Life can be generally seen as a series of steps of a backtracking solver. This is, a specific observation over a pattern that is visible in my own life. That is to say, and that I believe, it might not apply to other people as directly. 

The steps mainly consist of super goals and going into sub goals. When sub goals fail or are postponed I retract to super goals, which, at this very moment, triggers a very existential process of _goal revaluation_. And I would like you to focus on this motion. This picture as I am positing here, is not useless, which for myself I would try to remind myself of that too to be aware of this general process to not be carried away by sub goals. When it gets retracted all the way back to origin, it's called an existential crisis. Here, this forms a very substantial definition of the elusive idea.

# You should gain confidence by recognizing the finitude of your time and reasoning power

Two ways can it go

- I am lay person who has finite time and reasoning effort, so I must follow textbooks and governments
- I am lay person who is rationally bounded, so I should favor my _pet theories_ despite their possible unsoundness, because they are trustworthy. 

It is only after I realized my finitude in time that I can not read all books over philosophy that I developed more confidence in my own theories. 

And, ontologically, all theories are fundamentally pet theories. There is no valid distinction when the logical framework can be arbitrary.

Let me call it _transcendental humility_

# The most valuable thoughts are those that have never been put into words

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy) relevant

I find it utterly absurd that a huge number of people would read books (most prominently marxist books and christian scriptures), who comprosise a large portion of the modern political debate, and adhere to them strictly, and shun others for not knowing the said books. They barely think themselves. 

The most valuable thoughts are those that have never been put into words. The whim you get after some internal expedition, which surprised you so much that you immediately know that you have never felt this before, a brilliant new idea not present in the common vocabulary of the discourse at large or your own vocabulary. 

The real philosopher pulls theories out of thin void, utter void. The salesmen digest it and rebrand them for their own gains. 

On the dialectic side of justification, language gets gradually refined, aka, modified, adapated as the discourse goes, which is considered progress. Such radical ideas are logically a greater kind of dialectical progress.

## Paradox of competence

It's fairly safe to assume that the 'famous philosophers' are mainly characterized by their own thoughts and theories. Their knowledge about other philosophies are an addition mentioned in the support of their own philosophy. There isn't a gross negligence of past literature but the focus _is on_ their own ideas. A lot of people expect you to heavily cite past philosophical dicourse despite not demanding that aloud. The paradox is that, such criterion deems those with more original thoughts, incompetent, which includes those famouse philosophers. Originality is valued by people unless it comes to online discourse it seems.

We can probably also agree that, truth value is independent from reputation, popularity, authority. I claim X to be true with or without citing the source from which I derived the idea, which, often is European enlightenment. The claim should not appear more true or less true to you whether the source is revealed or not. 

# Guide to newborns

Prospective chronology suitable for reading by newborns.

- You are born in a random country, random family, given a name that you never chose yourself. 
- You are compelled to accept this body, the race, the culture that comes associated with it, the legal and social contracts of the country you live in. 
- You are forced into a prison-like education system. 0.1% of people did not make it. They killed themselves. 
- You are born into an abusive, poor family. 1% of people didn't make it.

# On the holography between Dialectics and State Machine

I found a potentially very inspiring similarity between the structures of dialectics and state machine, as in finite state transducer which I am more familiar with. I think the structural similiarity itself is worth noting down.

State machines are a recurring pattern throughout reality, which is the same for dialectics. 

To begin, a person's opinion can be modelled as a state machine, where every piece of information may push for the state change, or not. We call the pieces of information, deltas. Each delta may be modelled with classical logic, which conists of axioms and other data. Each delta is therefore on its own, perpetual, self consistent, and independent of external world. Each delta is a closed system of language that does not deal with correspondence with external world such as phenomena. 

Some deltas do not push for state change, ie, opinion change. We can regard them as useless information. This is how, meaningful dialectical progress may be defined over.

# Reductionism and where it works around

Reductionism is the method of choice in modern rationality. I noticed that we should work around, or that good theories work around the following

- Free will, irreducible, mainly in political theories
- State itself, in computer science related and whatever I mentioned, irreducible.
- End in itself, whenever we talk about means to end, we may reach a point of _end in itself_
- Ontology, irreducible. Thats why we mostly only care about phenomena. 

In retrospect, my algebraic theory of politics follows these rules, as it works around free will, goals of 'the particular system we may want'. They are treated as irreducible _atoms_ in the theoretical framework. And I pursued the productive path of analyzing everything other than the atoms. The theory may be roughly visualized as a graph connecting the irreducible atoms of 'free will' where the ontology of free will does not matter either.

I may call the atoms, ie, irreducible parts when rationalizing in a reductionist framework, _singularities_ in the chapters to come.

They are irreducible for a variety of reasons, maybe because the information is not yet available.

# Fear of market optimality

> Modern capitalism is as efficient as it can get. Your labour is so clearly priced. Stop overestimating yourself. 

It often seems as if the market has reach optimality where you can not change anything but to follow the rules. That every piece of valuable work can be reduced to mere capital, organization and talent that is simply interchangable with money. This is the market perspective, where goods, are in fact the singularities, left out not dealt with. The theory about the mechanisms isn't wrong, but we just noticed the singularities. 

That means we can work on them to "beat the market", better internal organization when it's a company or a state, more ideas when it's an individual, etc. 

# Dialectic maximization as a truth seeking algorithm

I have always been living by a method of _dialectical maximization_, specifically, I maximize the amount of change in personality through whatever life experience I can get. 

It did work. As elaborated earlier there is an assumption that for a particular set of beliefs, you should be able to _feed in_ new arguments, opinions, and data, which through a reconsideration of everything combined should gradually drive towards a more correct view over time, approaching truth ultimately. 

This method applied to life, is in practice applied to personality, which is the main causal component that determines the happening of your life, to a overwhelming degree.

In general, I see dialectic maximization as a pratical method of truth seeking that one human being can adopt. 

A person is in a naive blank tabula rasa state when born, and fed data through education system which are not very relevant in driving the development of personality overall. This starting point from a perspective of building a truth-seeking algorithm, is particular hard becuase there is very little true data, or beliefs that one can assume that one owns already, while the environment is full of adverse intentional or unintentional lies. How can such a person gradually obtain a set of beliefs that are _correct_, or ideal? In this case, the best method is through the _dialectic maximization_. Maximzie the amount of change and the rate of change (2nd order).

The algorithm requires minimal amount of beliefs to be assumed to be true. 

Truth seeking of a particular topic, is always inseparable from the truth seeking of a person's life as a whole. In other words, if you really tried your best to find truth in one topic, it will and should eventually change your personality. This is the profound contextuality, as in, how connected the things are.

Personality is the informal term I use for the largest rational context of a person, by which every topic is examined and reasoned. 

I also have a particular way of finding things that maximize my prospect of change. Say, an information source that is rich in various news about arxiv papers. The source could maximize the unpredictability of my future course of actions. I try to get more such sources as much as possible. Let me term it, _dialectic sources_, by which you maxmize your own unpredictability.

Then we can also derive _a particular definition of free will_, ie. free will as observed. Say we have a particular amount of data, where we can predict the prospect of N agents. We can obtain a matrix where each agent is assigned with a score of predictability. In this context we can consider the agent with maximal unpredictability as having most free will. No I am not talking about the nature, aka ontology of free will. Ontology is not discussed in depths at any moment by me. 

# Exotic systems that move faster than reason

The term capitalism is perhaps the most confusing and abused term in the discourse. In general, the term is approached from two opposite ends, the capitalism on paper, as desigend, as imagined, and the capitalism as observed, as reasoned from an external observer's perspective. Let me call them capitalism de jure and capitalism de facto, which should be talked about separatedly usually, but as a whole, it forms a very exotic system. 

The core of capitalism, is a matrix of wealth and a gradient of incentives it casts. Forget about all ideologies on capitalism. Here I am, proposing a perspective based on pure math. The system can manifest in any forms, with any laws and ideologies, by changing itself. The system can have one law about refund policy and some other laws the other day. This is, apparently what makes it confusing. The wealth matrix consists of rows where each row represents the total wealth of an agent, where each column is one particular form of wealth. The gradient of incentives is created by the fact that each agent wants more of wealth at any given moment.

I am not concerned with particular value judgement that it is good or evil but I admire the exoticness of such a system. This system does not exist by itself. It is created at some point. This is one example of engineering that involves very little effort (as in the amount data and complexity thereof that is needed in the blueprint) but massively profound impact. 

The system will persist far into future, reshaping its own definition, but we will recognize it as the same thing that changed itself. How surprising. It will persist until reality hardly resembles what it is right now, such as by erasing the existence of boundaries of consciousness itself, or that ownership can not be created in any form at all.

The system is said to move faster than reason because it has the incentive gradients that are desirable to a particular goal such as optimized production, despite the fact that no-one has laid down the particular plans of incentive gradients in a decree, which inevitably invovles reason, or, I call this a rational process, as in intentional command. The gradients exist before any theorist talks about capitalism, in almost any corner of reality. 

Game theoretic wise, capitalism is bad performing because every deal is cursed by a game of chicken, such that perhaps half of useful cooperation is not realized due to the competitiveness itself. I don't consider the competitiveness productive, as it is making everyone worse off. In manifest, many people are using broken products because it is a conflict between the totality of producers of a product and the consumers. They could not reach a deal where everyone is using optimal, non broken products (which is easily attainable by today's productivity). The situation is only sustained to keep consumers to properly fund the industry, which is not absolutely necessary but only product necessitated by a particular configuration of reality, laws, circumstances. 

Sometimes an invention is more of a discovery like what people do in cosmoslogy, rather an invention like some craftsman's product. Capitalism is one of the inventions that are actually, more of a discovery that people _may work in this particular way_. I see AGI in the same way. 

## Continuation, every system of power as a composition of two

I theorize that every incentived, or forced action in the society, consists of a component of intetionality by one agent, and a component of pure power. Capitalism is a system that works with, almost pure power. Wealth itself, in the purest form, is not conditioned upon any particular terms. Cooperative production is a product of conditioned wealth transfer, where the cooperation is faciliated by a product of power transfer and intetionality that is synthesized by a judicial system.

Wealth is such a weird thing as it exists today in the system. It is a form of power that can not be more pure. You can imagine that it can faciliate any trade that is possible, in the dark markets etc, because it's a form of power that is not pre-conditioned towards any particular goals.

The cooperation in dark markets is also cursed by how _free_, more precisely, _unconditioned_ wealth is. It's so free that it haunts cooperation. That's why normal markets have a powerful judicial system that exerts intentionality, which is better for human collaboration.

The more pure form of intentional system exists in more rigid hierarchies, such as miltiary systems. Individuals are assigend to do tasks by immediate decrees. Actions are mediated by a two component system where intentionality dominates and 'wealth' barely changes. Or, is it? We notice the ranks as a form of wealth in this system, although less liquid like normal capitalism. 

The core system of capitalism mainly deals with the condution of wealth, transfer, and what not. The counter-part is the condution of intentionality. In normal judicial system, conduction of intentionality is exerted through violence and threat of violence. The judicial system also creates a gradient of incentives despite being less pervasive than capitalism because evidently many scenarios are legally uncertain, until the judges announce a decision.

In purest forms, there exist intentional violence and unintentional pure wealth. The former is when one person forces an outcome upon another person. The latter is when one person owning more things while doing nothing to another person. Neither can exist without the existence of the others. In the first case, the one person that can exert violence clearly has more wealth, by definition. In the second case, the status quo itself that can not be disturbed is a form of intentioal violence. 

Ranks themselves, are pure power, despite titles and various descriptions being frequently associated with them. It is only in a regulated system of wealth where intentions are frequently exerted the system gradually gets recognized as a system of ranks for a particular set of goals. We consider an agent to be in a list of groups where each group has ranks and frequently associated goals.

The system of money is the largest group where all kinds of intentions are allowed such that the rank itself seems unconditioned and free. In some systems we construct it such that the ranks are only promoted with more specific goals.

Property system as to wealth, reputation system as to intentionality. Can we design such a system that is as powerful as the current property system? Wealth can often be reduced to each other, as in, people considering them equi-valuable. Are intentionalities often reducible to each other? The pervasive reductive nature of wealth makes a currency system possible, which in the simplest case reduces wealth to a scalar.

## Cooperation has to happen before consensus can be reached

It's a pipe dream to expect everyone to agree with you before all the work can be started. I would go as far to consider this a fairly common fundamental assumption of many leftist theories. They expect people to form a coalition where everyone is fully aware of their place in the production, what they do and why they deserve the treatment. 

It's simply too hard. There is too much difference in levels of intellect and countless other factors. 

Capitalism or such systems thrive because they do not demand a full consensus. The production directed through some level of violence. No it does not imply dirty-bloody violence, nor do I believe starvation is necessary in any way to enforce a particular leadership. Just some competent people taking the lead should change the entire dynamics where everyone else has to follow the trend.

In particular, I believe a good leadership must be enforced while using minimal violence. Assuming we want to re-engineer current society as it is, many artificial scarcity in goods can be eliminated because they merely serve as a violence a deterrant a punishment to prevent miscompliance of the leadership which I consider unnecessary anyway.

Such systems move faster than reason. On the other hand, it's a utopian dream where everyone can understand each other and everyone is literally religiously convinced of his fate in dying for a state as some sort of optimal configuration that necessitates his fate in case of defense.  

The phrase 'has to' is more of an observation over the imperative that we must drive production including defense before a utopian consensus is reached, due to the adverse nature of current reality. There is the urgency necessitating such cooperation, from the constant arms race of violence and financial power as a result of current configuration of reality at least.

# Systems design, open problem, iterative maxima

What is a good solution to systems design, or some open problem?

The solution that defies further iterative development, simplification, reduction. 

A worse solution gets refactored, simplified, reduced to simpler parts and reconstructed. 

A good solution defies such changes because it is already at an _iterative maximum_. 

- Solutions that are needlessly specific, get generalized, which is a reduction to a general solution + specific parameters.
- Solutions that under-estimate the number of variables are outcompeted by alternatives that do consider more variables. Many problems are Pareto optimization problems involving the human factor, UX, such as design of programming languages.

I may call this iterative maximum, or iteratively optimal. 

# Not all things are in total order

Here I present a useful pieceful of thought that is fairly pervasively used in identifying reality, coming from 

**Many things are falsely assumed to be in a total order, such as looks, which profoundly shape the worldviews of many people**

In a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order), everything is comparable with any other thing, which forms a linear sequence. 

The reality of a lot of things are [partially ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set#Partial_order). Notorious example being looks, where people either assume that the order does not exist, or that there exists a total order. People might not be aware that they are assuming the order, even, but they do it implicitly through their arguments.

Looks is a partial order where there are a few prevailing standards of looks, where in each lane there exists relative level of preference. I am not proposing any specific holistic partial order of looks, because I do not want useless controsversy. Rather, I am conjecturing that the thought space conforms to such a structure.

# Enligtened narcissism

I have developed this very specific kind of narcissism, where I am fully aware of my flaws that are considered flaws under specific assumptions (axiomatic or not). I contrast it with,

- Ignorant narcissism, the kind where people gain pride over their looks, nation-state, or money while not paying attention to the rest of reality. The nationalists can not accept criticisms. All of them can not accept what they do not have, do not own, including a lack of novelty in their personality.
- Repressed narcissism. I expect most people of this kind to gain siginifcant personality change, say if they gain massive wealth, power, or looks. The fact that their personality and views can change at all is a proof that they are not at an _iteartive maximum_

The awareness about my own flaws only strengthens my narcissism, because it is not longer predicated on a flawless fiction, a delusion of weak foundation.

# Reduction by calculus

I suggest an application of calculus in the analysis of values, and philosophy in general. 

If an outcome is noble, such as a utopia, the goals are justified as noble, and all the necessary steps leading up to the outcome are justified too. There is a nuance here that gets political very quick. What is necessary? Is the communist dictatorship necessary? Were the communist wars justified? I don't care about the answers since you can derive them, nor do I care enough to state my current views on politics, and the answers are trivial when compared to the thought process.  


$$
v_2 = \mathbf{r}(a) + \int_a^b \mathbf{r}'(t)\,dt
$$

The equation represents a path from $v_1 = r(a)$ to destination $v_2$

Each $r'(t)$ represents a instant of free will where you make choices and the integral is a vector, which is also, a point in the 2D space. 

# Fraction and necessity of causality

The working class of drivers as a whole are causally necessary in the functioning of society, but an individual thereof, is not necessary. The importance, and necessity of the individual, is fractioned over the whole of causal node that is as a whole necessary to a noble goal. An ordinary worker is often seen as trivial because the fraction might be $1/100000$. I'm not positing that he is trivial or not. Rather, the word _trivial_ is too simple to capture the totality of the meaning here. Or from another angle you can refine the triviality of such a worker through the understanding of this section. 

An outcome that is valued treated as noble, usually has many many causal nodes that may lead up to it. The fractionation and elusive necessity is central to much of the existential contemplation.

Reduction by calculus tracks causality from a perspective of a single temporal trajectory. This section, examines a single step in causality.

# Prophetic logic and causality

TBD

# Contingent morality and the worhip of status quo

It is praised when a richman donates money to a poor person to alleviate his pain, but, we are assuming way too much things here. 

The praise is predicated on the fact that some people are impoverished, as a part of the greater whole of the status quo, which for brevity I refer to as _the real_.

This is a particular definition of _the real_, as opposed _the possible_. Not the Kantian real or whatever other definitions, but the real as in the status quo.

The real includes the fact that some people look pretty and some people look ugly, some people are rich, and that current processors typically have a maximal frequency of 5GHz.

A lot of values of current humans, boil down to to the worship of _the real_. People do not care about _the possible_.

Again, I rarely condemn people or praise anything. It's observation and facts that matter. That's all.

# Measurement of meaningful undestanding through dialectic delta

I have a personal way of measuring whether I understand this piece of philosophical text, simply by the rate of change to my own views.

If it's generic agreeable arguments, the change is minimal. I might be getting the correct interpretation, but it doesn't matter since I already have it in my own system.

If it changes my own view in any way. It might not be the right understanding, but it's good anyway because dialectic change is good _in any case_.

Following this methodology, on the 2nd order, I try to gain more sources that give me such change.

# Morality constructed on vector of intention and effect

Usual theories of morality each treats the system as a system constructed on intention, or effect. The _de facto_ morality of human rights is of deontology, which is based on intention as in it says what people should do in what circumstances, and a morality based on deontology of the justice of contracts, especially private property. Another popular morality is utilitarianism, socialism, which emphasize systems constructed based on reasoning about effects, and anti-natalism which is popular on internet. 

The precise definition of intention and effects can be seen from section _Reduction by calculus_.

These systems, share a common feature that they revolve around a fundamental element of either intention, or effect. 

What if nature of reality is more nuanced? Thats why advocate for a system of morality, on the fundamental level, based on a 2D vector of `(intention,effect)`, where `intention` and `effect` are not typical algebraic objects like real numbers. They represent immediate tendency of actions on the forementioned causal trajectory and consequences (effects, possible world) on the causal graph.

It is often absurd to live a life when you have to reach noble goals through oftentimes, bad or evil means. The classical problem is how a utopia necessitates great wars, which is a common topic people litigate over in online discourse.

A person might not have the traits you appreciate, but those very same traits give him a function, make him function as a person that achieve certain effects _that you appreciate_. This also implies a view of a split of a person as dual of his function in the world and his authentic self, haunting and pervasive.

Having these concerns in mind, you get frustrated and start thinking how absurd all of the reality is, and slack off. Still, I hold the position that _absurdity is not real_ but a hint that might drive you into greater rationalization of the world, and eventually reach an impression of eureka in polar opposite to the impression of the absurd.

# Compounding causality, a historical analysis

Here I present a view on development of history that is related to previous elaboration on, _wisdom vs intellect_.

Intellect is a computation power which derives answers given a computation process, while wisdom, is the answers themselves.

I have developed this exotic view on history that history is unfolded on a compounding causality.

From $t_1$ to $t_2$, the change that may happen is bounded by the computational power and the data that may be used available. The data part is the so-called wisdom as they can enable faster computation shortcuts. The computation may be done by anybody. We see it as a collective process. 

The possible change is bounded by the computation; hence the wisdom. It's such weird that the possible change is continually increasing over time. Let's call it action space.

Trivially, wisdom never decreases, because more data is always better, which _increases the action space perpetually_.

I'm not concerned over production, or specific changes in organizational structures of society, because my theory does not care for these temporary and utterly specific things that change in a short time frame. The action space has been in constant and increasing rates of higher-order increase since the discovery of fire, the use of language and paper, the invention of general computers.

## The ever increasing computable space

It's also worth noting that some answers are not possible without particular data. That is to say for a particular process of computation in the time frame $t_1 \to t_2$, some answers are fundamentally non-computable without particular inputs of data. _More things are becoming computable over time._

What makes this possible? Brute-force! The computability theory says some answers can not be arrived by a particular algorithm with available data, but it never said we can't just do a correct guess. It's always a guess, by tautology. Let me prove it. 

If an answer is unreachable before $t_2$ through all computation methods and data we had before $t_2$, but we gained access to the answer after $t_2$. The only possibility is that we guessed it. Otherwise, it was either non-computable or we did not do the compute. Nothing prevents a heuristic algorithm to just spew out non-computable answwers because computability theory only applies to what it is defined over. 

There is a true joke that, you can simply guess the correct preimage at the first time for a SHA256 hash with good enough luck, or any answer to some Turing-non-computable problem. 

# Multiple perspectives can be true, simultaneously

It's often viewed competitively that if you believe in one theory, you must reject another. Just a very powerful bias I noticed in myself recently. The great theories from academia can be true, and your own theories can be true too. There is no need to fear when others talk about the great theories. 

# Solving the old 'reputation system problem' from a metalogic perspective

Reputation systems are increasingly prevalent in modern systems

- Ranks of a nation-state
- Capital, where the amount of capital in particular, currency, decides one's agency, the amount of power one has to direct production through legal means.
- IP quality, as implied in the internals of Cloudflare and various IP blacklists
- Risk control in online social media platforms
- CA systems starting from CA root, a centralized PKI.
- GPG public key infrastructure, as an example on establishing a PKI decentrally, which I do not consider, ideal.

The 'reputation' isn't reputation _per se_, which in usual sense means fame or recognition by an audience. 

There are potentially many ways to formalize this, which I came to belief is the core complexity of the said problem. Method wise, it's always ok to throw a random neural network to do the predictions. However, I want to do an analysis from the philosophical view point, to avoid the [explainability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) and perhaps offer more profound insight towards the iterative maxima.

- Define 'reputation' as compliance towards a specific goal, such as not creating spam, successful trades.
    - If we try to create a system upon this goal, it's destined to be a narrow system, by tautology.
- etc. not listing more

## Trust, and a prevalent phenomenon of isolation of invidiuals in the modern world

This should derive some extra ideas that is adjacent to the above ideas on reputation systems. 

Most transactions of modern world tend to be clearly priced, mass saled, platformed products or labor, or transactions faciliated through institutions or legal formal processes. That's a fact. It's simply rare that two people get together and cooperate without a contract. And it's rare even though people can sign contracts. 

Trust is a highly profitable element. Examples that _profit off trust_ include 

- Gangs that involve drug sales or other illegal activities
- Corruption that can not work without secrecy
- Employment. If an employer can trust another person to hold the capability of work without a degree, the total cost on both people get reduced drastically. The employer can pay less and the employee gets to not go to a university which, depending on the person, is a massive saving in time, and pain.
- Business deals.

Here the metalogic should abstract as much things as possible, such as specific algorithms of evaluating trust. 

In a simple model, let's say the goal is to risk control over spamming of users on a platform. It's irrelevant what algorithms are used here, because I will take an approach from the side of observer. For such a system, it is inevitably a decision making system. And such a system inevitably is a system that processes useful, reliable information into actionable results.

We can already derive a theorem from the information part. 

### Theorem, trust system is information-bounded

Without information, it's impossible to make better decisions that are better than random draws.

This is applicable to any form of trust system.

### Theorem, trust system is truthiness-bounded

Consider we have hardware sensors that are protected by police that identify if a user is a real person, which sends a signed message over the wire when an identification is made. We may also have other sources of information for such purpose. The system may adopt both sources and cross-analyze, but the total amount of truthiness is considered to be constant. (This is more like a definition rather than an assertion)

The truthiness of that signed message, is a result of deliberate construction of such a physical system, as a particular configuration of matter of reality, such that it performs our intended goal of identifying a living human.

Inevitably, a trust system will get political because it will create a gradient of incentives. Agents in the system will try to exploit for gains. The truthiness of input may gradually degrade as that happens. 

From the chronological perspective, if the truthiness resists exploitation, we consider this trust system to be robust.

Truthiness is formally defined as the degree that data points match the matter in reality. The political side that it causes people to be controlled, to act controlled, is merely a side effect. 

It's also common that trust systems utilize rewards and punishment in society to optimize truthiness, but we should be clear about the notions here.

I divide reality into two compartments of realms.

1. Realm of information, where data exist on its own
2. Realm of physicality, the rest of reality.

The realm of information is the data that a trust system, which is a computational process, can access. More specifically, a trust system is formally defined as a function $f: T_1 \to T_2$ that is computable within certain bounds, where $T_{1,2}$ are tensors for input data and output verdicts.

Data is useless without a mapping onto physical reality, especially in this context. The degree the said data tethers onto reality is considered its _degree of truthiness_. 

Usually the two realms are connected by sensors, human attestations, and in more complex setups, institutions, political structures where humans work in pre-designed ways producing predictable results.

### What we can do?

The matter in this section does not really concern about getting more information, or more truthiness, because they are outside of the scope, while I believe they are the actual, urgent goals for better trust systems.

If we limit our scope to a particular, isolated trust system, we can see it being deficient in information and truthiness. It could have integrated more information and truthiness into the decision-making process.

A trust system is also inevitably computational, resembling human reason. Currrent state is that most trust systems are very dumb algorithms.

- Increase the "intellect" of trust systems
- Integrate more data sources by connecting other trust systems 
    - Consider a trust system here to be, an individual program operated by a web site.
    - Current systems are poorly interoped.
- Integrate more truthiness sources

# Systmatic analysis over values

Particular personal goals often change. It is therefore necessitated to survery the whole of possible values or goals one can have. 

In this section we are not concerned with particular values that are justified by values in a larger context, where the particular values serve as means to the greater values, such as my effort in [nsproxy](https://github.com/ple1n/nsproxy) for enabling freedom, which is a means-to-end relationship.

Values in general, exist as a chain of justification, as observed in population. Why work? It benefits society, the nation, gets money which gets an person's his pleasures. The justification ends here because _pleasure_ is a singularity as defined above. It's a blackbox to rational reduction, almost impenetrable to reason.

My survey over theories I have come across shows that most values often land the values in changes in reality. They value change. Since the disenchantment humans have gradually shifted all their values into change, and hedonism. Change represents the real in the future, and hedonism represents the real, as in status quo. In brief, _change, and reality_. A huge number of ideologies land the ultimate value of everything in creating a utopia, where no further justification is needed or given and everything else valuable points towards the utopia.

Some people see the termination of the chain of justification as a proof of nihilism. It's plausible. Yet all theories of today are axiomatic in nature in the sense that they need assumptions.

I see nihilism as an invalid philosophical position. It's a mere stimuli, as illusionary as the impression of the divine. That's my insight as a person with experience with frequent mood swings and as a psychonaunt. 

# Dictatorship is bad?

> An ontological investigation into the concept of _dictatorship_

What do you mean by dictatorship? There are 7 billion people on the planet. Even if we consider the 7 billion only, there are 7 billion kinds of dictatorship. That means you are referring to 7 billion "dictatorships" where each one is different, each one serving as a possible and plausible definition of your _dictatorship_. 

You are making a categorical mistake to dismiss the whole idea of dictatorship when you perceive a subset of possible dictatorships as bad. The old soviet-style states are dictatorships, and, democracy, private property are also dictatorships.

Formally, I define dictatorship as an exclusive control over the future outcome of events, over a geographic region or any other abstract region such as internet spaces. 

What does this imply? It means reality will _always_ be _inhabited_ by some form of _dictatorship_, such as apathy, randomness, arbitrariness. It is only when the control is enchanted with a free will from a free being, people call it a _dictatorship_. That is to say, _dictatorship_ is fundamentally unavoidable because we live in a world where the course of events follows a single trajectory. The coin either lands heads or tails. When the 'thing' that decides it is randomness, we usually don't call it a dictatorship. I call this _**dictatorship of randomness**_.

> Ideas transcend terms. Did you notice that your definition get enriched and changed through the reading of the text. That's what I call dialectics. 

The necessary consequence followed by the above reasoning, is to stop trying to eliminate _dictatorship_, figures of power of any kind. The current politics is insecure about such fact that they are inventing complex mechanisms, various councils, ineffective democracies, which end up empowering dictatorships elsewhere. They are so avoidant about apparent forms of _dictatorship_, while their fixes are elaborate processses that eventually result in a single resolution of deeds, or non-action where non-intervention itself is a _dictatorship_ which can result in suffering in cases where the cruelty of nature causes that.

> Do I support _dictatorship_?

I do not support _dictatorship_ as in the common definitions circulating on internet and offline. It's more accurately called authoritarianism, despite that they are frequently conflated.

Speaking of my definition _dictatorship_, there is not 'support it' or not, because it's simply a feature of reality that can not be removed.

# Psychonauntics and philosophy

> It's impossible to be a philosopher without being a psychonaunt first. 

There isn't a need to be philosopher for everyone. It's quite mentally draining actually, sometimes harmful, and deception may be good anyway.
But under the assumption that you want to be a philosopher, it's imperative that you be a psychonaunt. 

I've found that the immdiate perceptions, impressions, and impulses are some of the most powerful biases in the way of human reason. High sex drive blocks personality development.

There isn't a way to get rid of these impressions, but mood changes can shuffle them. 

If a simple flip in mood changes your views, it means your reasoning is dialectically incomplete anyway. We consider _the integration of more information is always correct_ a fundamental assumption, just as elaborated earlier in the dialectics section.

Introspection has its bounds. Substances can help. Sometimes you enter this realm because you have to, you get prescribed anti-depressants.

Disregard international standards. They don't matter. They are wrong. I compiled a list based on personal experience over the phenomena that are observable to me.

Nobody needs these theories when you can access the phenomena unless the state blocks the access.

I have substantial disagreement with DSM theories and taxomoy of mental disorders. They are utterly wrong.

- Hypomania
    - Confidence, ego inflation, grandiosity
    - Motivation
    - Disinhibition
    - Increased desires, appetite and enjoyment thereof
    - I do not regard this as a mood disorder. Rather, I consider it the optimal state of being.
    - [David Pearce](https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/philosophyforum2021.html), too, advocates the state of hypomania.
- Depression. Taxonomy wise I consider there to be 3 sub-types of depression.
    - Anhedonia, lack of motivation, feeling of meaninglessness, feeling of nihilism.
        - sometimes manifesting in anorexia, but anorexia doesn't constitute anhedonic depression
        - lack of enjoyment, fulfillment, reward from activities such as eating
        - treatment, stimulants, or any drug with stimulating property.
    - Dysphoria, general unease, unexplained discomfort
        - everyone can experience this with a sufficient dose of antipsychotics, which was used as a torture [method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacological_torture#Soviet_Union). 
        - note that _Haloperidol_ is associated with neurotoxic metabolites
    - Melancholy, sadness
        - I consider it a type of mood problem when I have sadness without any reason. It's simply logically absurd that I should be sad without any reason any change in circumstances, isn't it.
        - treatment, serotonergic agents, such as Zolmitriptan.
    - I generally consider stimulants a better treatment than SSRIs, because SSRIs cause long-term profound changes in neuronal weights and brain structure, sometimes causing a huge personality shift for better or worse.
- Anxiety
    - Rumination
        - Repeated worries usually with internal dialogue
        - Many people resort to Ethanol, which is a very terrible drug that has catastrophic metabolic consequences. Literally Butanol or other longer-chained alcohols are better if you like solvents that much.
        - treatment, _Pregabalin_
            - Pregabalin empties the mind 
            - the drug is markedly safer than Ethanol for long-term consumption, for its lack of liver metabolism, activation of irrelevant receptors or inhibition of metabolic enzymes etc, although I do not endorse long-term consumption of psychotropics due to the risks.
            - Benzodiazepines are not very effective
    - Agitation
        - Inability to focus
        - No apparent reason or problems to ruminate or worry over
        - Cardiovascular effects that can be felt
        - treatment
            - beta blockers especially _Propanolol_
            - $\alpha_{2a}$ agonists such as [Guanfacine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine) 
                - they are fairly potent orthostatic hypotension agents, while beta blockers don't have a fraction of the effect, to my surprise.
                - I don't endorse Guanfacine as optimal. It's just what I have tried so far.
            - Atomoxetine
                - It's fairly absurd that ADHD agents are put in this bucket, but I reasonably believe they act on the same neuronal pathway.
            - Benzodiazepines
                - Alprazolam is noted for its potent and rapid anti-depressant effects. They derived [Adinazolam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adinazolam) following the inspiration.
    - Social anxiety, shyness as a personality
        - SSRIs for months
            - I personally believe SSRIs permanently decreased my sex drive too
        - This is a special one because it's a matter of neural structure and weights

# Language politics

Democracy, sales, and politics at its surface, are increasingly dominated by the mechanism of memetics. The discourse and reasoning of people are frequently affected by the biases inherent to language in the typical way people use it. Perhaps language is the largest institution overall. 

I have hence been proposing a retreat from language. It's especially important for people who are new to reason and politics. 

Various conflicts of modern day are pretty much a result of the institution of language, the conflicts over races, genders, nation-states. I see them as drama that only take place on social media and pamphlet of embassies that serve as nothing other than performative art.

Systems that base on the institution of language, are somewhat bad I'd say. Examples being bureaucracy which needs laws regulations various processes intensely based on language, and democracy which needs endless litigations. Language tends to lag behind truly transformative ideas, especially if you want the a large audience to fully digest it. 

I find it funny that people constantly argue, fight and die genuinely for these terms, labels of languages, including the symbols, flags, the fixed notions that they represent. Yet if we do not use language to protect some minories, assign labels to them and codify the protection into law, people will probably start bullying them as some sort of usual process, as if it is a part of human nature. 

Races, nations are in particular a funny element in the theatre of modern politics. Such notions are elusive because they are partially real, yet fail and will never capture the whole of reality. Just as how I treat the self as a bundle of impressions, knowledge and various processes (I do not acknowledge the existence of the self), races are too a construct that captures the phenotype and behavior of majority. The label draws that much attention because the real part has real political, economical consequences. Most people are not aware that the real part and the fiction part are bundled into one label.

It took humanity so much time to invent new 'symbols' that play a role in the threatre of history. Notably, _proletariat_ from the leftists. Yet most of them acted like swarm and fell for the same trap of language. 

I intentionally coined the term _outliers_, in the hope that it serves as a living, anthropomorphic drive and instance on the way dialectics drives the world forward.

# History as a result of free will

Countless people believe in the these right-wing or left-wing theories about the grand theory on the development of history. The iron laws of capital exploitation, recurring patterns in development of civilization. Great historians have figured out all of it, a long time ago, isn't it. Just as what happened in the past, the future must be alike, and you should study more history!

Fundamentally, I believe history is driven by free will and randomness, deliberate choices made by key people, those who are in power, those who had the chance to get their voices heard, those who have the wealth and transformative ideas. The modern day world is to a large degree a consequence of a ton of deliberate choices of key people during WW2 and a ton of coincidences on the key trajectory of events.

There are certainly recurring patterns in society. Companies exploiting people in predictable ways, making profit off capital in predictable ways, countries going to war at each other in predictable patterns. They, however, do not matter, because we focus on change. What's the point on focusing on these repeated patterns? You are looking for disappointment, or confirmation if you like it. Those who look into the repeated patterns are just going into the confirmation bias to make their theories seem useful. Their theories have zero predictive power for all the changes that happened.

Change is fundamentally driven by outliers. Patterns persist until they are changed. I base my predictive power on a clear tether on the theorization on causality. A rich man has more causal relevance than a minimal wage worker, typically. That's the difference in causal relevance that we must acknowledge. To a given outcome, there are causal factors that dominate, and the factors that are trivial. That's the Pareto stance. 

History is a matter of creation. There is not a determined future. There is no guarantee in any good or bad ending. 

I expect a future much more bizarre, unanticipated for the years to come, perhaps in a good way. 

# It's sound to refute a point by providing a seemingly irrelevant argument

> Sound as in logically valid. 

I found this to be a fairly interesting phenomenon in debates and reasoning in general. 

In some cases it's indeed going off-topic, but in other cases, this can serve a true rebuttal. 

You can say the capitalism as its current state, is causing poverty and crime and go about your whole ideology and propose a lot of solutions. I won't disagree with you on that, but without my addendum, your point is invalid. Notice I am not, in anyway directly refuting your point.

Politics of the time is locking up people with limited food (supply of currency) in a cage (private property and state power where _many things you need are not even for sale_ such as custom medicine). Some people go about justifying people doing crime and killing each other as a result of circumstances, and aspirations of weath equality of various kinds. 

I propose the aspiration that some people take the lead and break the cage instead. It's not like the person talking to me didn't want to break the cage. It's rather him not focusing on how the cage is broken, which makes his reasoning partial. The arguments seem to not relate to each other directly, but they are addressing the same thing of reality. 

Providing addendum is a sound way to refutation as long as it changes _the thought of a person_ to any dialectic delta.


# Refactoring of philosophy, a tradition brought from computer science

I have found it better to refactor philosophy and recompile the source code myself. It's common in fields of engineering to rebuild things but most people are hesitant to rebuild their worldview, methods of reason. 

# Discrete mathematics as the only relevant ontology

- Causality, language $\to$ Graphs
- Concepts, identities, [impressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume#Impressions_and_ideas), objects $\to$ Tensors
- [Emergence](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/) $\to$ Integral

I've so far used discrete mathematics extensively to build my system of ontology. I see debates over overly speculative nature of things as futile and will not produce meaningful gains. Plus, there are many many ways to examine the same object of reality. There is not a need to obsess with any specific way of philosophy such as going into those speculative dead ends.

# Non-predictable factors and predictable factors

In the continual flow of reality as it develops, would you not consider some people to be fairly passive and predictable where other people act like blackboxes, acting as a source of change that drive such predictable sequences. There isn't a bound on the perspectives you can create. It simply makes more sense to create a perspective where some people are considered the causes of change. 

Some people always argue that anyone can be regarded a source of change. This is not wrong in the way that you can create a perspective where they are treated as source of change and begin an analysis, but such perspectives are inherently less efficient and lack explanatory power in comparison to, said better perspectives.

# Cooperation between enemies

I found this as a trait of capitalism. Two nations would have gone to war without an international system of capitalism where the money is what I considered _unwilled money_, the purest form of wealth that does not have any strings attached. It's imaginable in such a situation the conflict can be settled by financial means. 

Such a system can even enable cooperation between enemies, between mutually disagreeing parties on morality, while in the end, forming a supply chain which may serve some noble goals that we value. This does not happen in a usual leftist rationally-designed system where the system expects people to hold a common worldview.

# Empirical study of capitalism

- Short-lasting contracts, settlement. Lack of viable long-term cooperation and accountability. 
    - Price of justice might be a rate-limiting factor
- Delegation (sometimes into authority) as a form of cost saving which could be detrimental
- Too much conflict during price negotation, the game of chicken.
    - A lot of deals are not made because the game is fierce, which result in losses of both sides. Either potential profits are not made, or the manufacturer end up re-implementing some existing technologies.
    - Socialism should address this conflict. 
- Dimensionality reduction into prices is inherently suboptimal, if the system is to be seen as product of intentional design.
    - The system can be seen as an optimization process towards an optimal price, yet deals in reality require much, more than just price information. Authorities, certifications, various systems got invented over time to undo the "dimensionality reduction"
- Rational descent as a viable strategy of revolution in the era of capitalism
    - It is a rational descent when both producers and consumers optimize towards their goal of cost-saving and gain-maxing.
    - It is a rational descent when all people start adopting a more free currency, such as cryptocurrency, globally but not coordinated. 
- Capitalism as a game of bounty hunter.
- Capitalism as a framework structure where more complex political systems can be layered upon.
- Capitalism as a pervasive incentive structure that leads to the full causal chain from production to consumption where every contract is incentived fiscally, until the last, sales contract.
- Flat pricing dominates most deals and has consequences
- Capitalism inherently produces a system of privileges, which is needless.
    - Products that produce more satisfactory are priced higher
    - Flat pricing is usually unavoidable, such that we can not discriminate consumers
    - The two lead to an inevitable result that, to keep the richer consumers pay for better services, better products are more expensive. Otherwise they would not pay. 
    - On the other hand, intentionally worsend products are produced to maximize total realized profit / deals made, as long as the downsized products do not affect the sales of premium products.
    - This phenomenon is so ubitquitous

## How do we expect a system to make correct decisions

Say we can put a cabel of people in control, or set up a system, there is a measurable load on the system that it has to make certain amount of decisions, where some decisions turn out in our favor and some do not. The decisions, in turn, also changes the system itself, in a self catalysed loop.

I think the more decisions the system is designed to handle, the faster it fails. In a state machine model, I would consider the state of failure a terminal state that can hardly go back, such as a state of oligarchy, authoritarianism, centralization of various kinds which prevent further change into other states.

Modern capitalism amplifies the correct decisions it believes in through a series of amplification mechanisms. 

Supreme court $\to$ Lower courts (incorrect decisions get overriden) $\to$ Financial institutions (incorrect decisions lead to profit loss) $\to$  Producers

In each step there involves a combination of threat of violence from a more powerful party, self-policing by a prediction over profit or punishment. 

# Morality, by Hume

I tried to distance my self from moral judgement in my essay whenever possible. I do not believe in any grand theory of morality that can be explained in simple words, like 'workers deserve fair pay'. I believe in a morality that is extremely nuanced, sometimes absurd and contrived.

If the average workers actually get fair pay, they will spend it on useless products, and prop up huge industries for momentary hedonism. It's a fact that the rich have so much money they don't know where to spend and the poor of the time can't even get a place to live. Inevitably they will blow the money on anime figurines, various copes that serve as nothing but a futile attempt at more of momentary hedonism.

To begin contemplation on morality, it must start from ground state, _the Humean stance_. Hume has a strong [emphasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is–ought_problem) that the theories on 'ought' reside in a different realm than theories of 'is'.

I enjoy moral _hypotheticals_. It would be a good hypothetical when an entrepreneur _deceived_ normies, _extracted_ their wages to invest in the making of truly transformative development. You get fascinated by the results not knowing the full causal details that led up to it. This is the absurd.

# If optimizing is the state of society, it is usually under-optimized.

People tend to have fears when they want to do something out of the ordinary, start a business, because they think the society is _optimized_ and everything is saturated. No new things need to be written and companies already doing the best. Propaganda have done a great job preaching market as a mechanism.

It is true that it is a perpetually optimizing system, yet people tend to assume it is _optimized_, without much evidence whatsoever. It is actually _underoptimized_ in most cases.

# Ethics that is not conditioned on labour

I have always been cautious when it comes to 'ought' problems. 

History of recent decades have been in a gradual shift of labour. In the past pretty much everyone can participate in menial, blue-collar physical labour. 

Consequentially, the right-wingers claim _those who work deserve cash_, the left-wingers claim _those who work deserve food_. The development gradually shifted the demands. The vast majority of laborers do not produce even a fraction of value, produced by one single engineer in algorithms, or an AI scientist. Fundamentally, those are work ethics. 

By their very same ethics, the vast majority deserve nothing? I'm sure they would like this idea.

I'm certain most jobs in most countries serve as nothing but nominal jobs that would have generated wages lower than what could sustain one's life. The system barely maintained the wages through the ubiquitous law of minimum wages and various policies that push for such coverage. They are just _masked welfare_. You think you are compensated for the efforts. In reality, you are getting relief checks in disguise.

# Egoless elitism

I coined the phrase considering there would be people who consider my theory elitism, which is partial. The ego is never the point since I do not even acknowledge its existence. The greatest achievements in history are just those _sparks of ingenuity_ that were followed by masses who try to adopt and appropriate the fruits for their own profits. Ideas just come to me. I would not consider myself entitled because the fact that ideas came to me.

Out of all perspectives, only the view that all events began through a spark of singularity that sometimes resides in a person's mind followed by a sequence of much more predictable outcomes, makes most sense and holds most explanatary power compared to all other views.

There is no point in debating whether free will exists, nor am I interested in its litigation of ontology beyond what serves productive goals of this post. Free will, is only conisdered as it appears, the apparent fact that you can make decisions and nothing beyond it, the apparent fact that it serves as an instrument in the happening of causality.

Historicism is partial because it can not account for the pervasive existence of free will. And it's a theory for the masses anyway because it teachs people to expect things to happen spontaneously. Either way, it's not going to hold any predictive power.

# Equality to be assumed until further justification

I do not hold the view of equality simple as it seems, but rather I consider it a stance to be held without further evidence or need to change the view, as a starting point of thought. I hold the accusation why you would set up such an arbitary view or privileges instead of this _null stance_.

It is the void of reason that I call equality, not that I want to sweep things such that they appear equal.

I also have a disregard, or disdain for the status quo. Reason knows no temporal bounds. People get irritated over borders that get disputed that get moved a little bit, not knowing how much different it was in the past.  It's a very common fallacy to reason in the way relative the status quo. Reason should be, absolute, relative to the origin point of null stance.

People call it a crime when a rich person gets his wealth reduced a bit, because its a reasoning with the status quo as a reference point. The correct method is to at least track it further back in time where nobody is much more wealthy, or the null stance where nobody is wealthier or less.
