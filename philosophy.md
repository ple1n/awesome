# "Against" Marxism, the pinnacle of academic obscurantism

There is not a journal dedicated to how you, specifically, you, your personal being, should live your life. There is no formal (academic) school of philosophy that really deals with this topic. Instead, you see all the manosphere, or feminist, or parentally preached content. There is a dire need for everyone that lives, a need that is immediate, a need that begins when he ever starts thinking about his life. Admit it, just admit it. The academia is impenetrable to the commoners, especially the wageslaves (or will-bes), the people who can not afford time. This void, is then filled with various cultists, such as the nationalists, the religious preachers, the parents, the mass media, which serve as an excellent proof that the void exists, that the need is so dire. 

Am I against Marxism? This is off-topic. 

Marxists tell you to read their books and cite elaborate details. Christians do very much the same, as if they want to show off their rich memory of theology. They continue to talk as if everyone agrees with their entire glossary of definitions, acting surprised when you attempt to question their defintions.

I'd term what I hereby advocate, as practical philosophy, or better, _immediate philosophy_. What is immediate philosophy is what is immediately understandable, useful, truthful, loyal, to you, your own needs and goals. 

## What if the commoners should be deceived

I even advocate for a deception of the self, _suspension of doubt_, or some call it a *leap of faith*.

Deception is surprisingly common and necessary. The causal argument for that is many things we deem good end up having deception, a necessary premise.

Deception is not all equal. Here I apply a reasoning tactic I often use, the _assumption of non-identity_, a tactic that belongs to reasoning about ontology. We may use the same word 'deception' (and in the same meaning) in many contexts. Then almost driven by momentum, we try to apply our belief such as 'authenticity is good' sweepingly. 

I call this method, _philosophy of nuance_. I value direct observation, direct theorizing, and coining your own terms. 

The worst thing about a *leap of faith*, is that it's often impossible for the obsessive reasoners. Then ultimately the leap is only possible with some sort of external circumstances, which are all a form of coercion.

Here, I used another tactic, the separation of a theory and its effect/usage/feasibility. I argue that a theory that urges people to do anything, must not be separated from its effect. The blame it receives when it fails to work, is equally applicable to the theory itself. 

## Live in a world of higher narrative framework

I see emotions, pains, happiness, as a form of violence. I have tried to conceptualize them again and again. I worked around them. Only their effects can be conceptualized.

All forms of philosophy so far value well-being, which ultimately, inevitably lands in sensory well-being. I don't use happiness, or pleasure, since they would have caused confusion. 

The very observation that all philosophies point to the same thing, and not just popular cultures, is in some way horrifying in itself. It would be absurd to not pursue well being, as the end of all means, as the ultimate end that is "self-justified", but per _Hume_, we can not derive _outght_ from _is_. The ought to well-being is a form of violence. A violence that is forced upon humans beings of the time.

Human beings are forced to live in the moment, surrounded by the dialogue with others, the monologue, the immediate urges, passions and emotions. Occasionally a person may think of 'nihilism' of some sort, or immerse in a grandiose wholistic worldview from a novel. The violence pulls you back. 

The immediate narrative which a person often lives in, is poorly logical, fragmented. 

## Retro-metacognition, when you discover hidden beliefs

Hedonists live a life, often without the awareness that they believe 'hedonism is to be valued' implicitly. The implication is revealed when we step back from ourselves and observe our own behavior from the outside. What is most convincing is the case when I discover my past but hidden beliefs myself. 

I live in the fear of implied beliefs. They could drive major decisions and what is hidden is assumed and most dangerous.


# The Scream of Outliers

> Tribute to Kafka.

There has always been a strange feeling in countless encounters in my life, the moment I was misunderstood, the moment when I was left alone, estranged. The feeling stayed through my life until I gradually started to put it into words. There is not a single instance of such feeling, or situation that is worth noting down here. Nor is it worth sharing with others, because they are doomed to be not understood, *Kafkaesque*. I always believed, however, the true answer to human compassion is through reason, not emotions, with the all-encompassing sweeping generalizations. 

The concept of pain was a good one, capturing a huge range of negative feelings. Then, here comes the *estrangement*, or being an outlier, which I use due to its mathematical undertone. The *estrangement* is perhaps even worse than pain, which is perhaps just dull and bland. 

Modern society has harnessed reason as a tool of ruling. Reason, as defined by governments. Reason is defined to be a set of barely changing laws. Reason is defined to be a set of institutions. Reason is upheld and justified. The law applies its "reason" equally tolerating no exceptions or outliers. 

The communists have tried. They established a new dictatorship. They executed the rich, tolerating no outliers. The racists tried, setting up concentration camps, shutting down immigration. What is truly wrong with humans. Is the problem, a class struggle, a racial struggle, or, just the struggle of outliers?

Praise the outlier. The one Chinese who goes against his own race with critique hasher than outsiders. The one man who is different from the norm of his gender. And most importantly how he then goes agaisnt the norm of "the queer community" he used to, or you think he would, belong to.

The outliers may become regonized, occasionally, rising to the status of "the minority". They stopped being outliers the moment that happens. Yet, the outliers continue to exist. You become the outlier when you disagree with "the minority". There is never any recognition of the outlier in the current way the society think about things, because the minority is recognized due to their political status, not as an inherent element of thought.

The dialectic is almost shaped by a constant _betrayals_ of communities. 

- I betrayed my own race or nation, marked by the sharp criticism which many of the nationals see me as dissident.
- I betrayed various online communities such as those who shared my same criticism of the nation and race, due to differing views.
- I betrayed 'queer communities' or things of this kind that I do not want to name more. 

The outliers shall not fear betraying communities. They stand with nothing but the dialectic motion itself, whom I consider a physical embodiment of the dialectics. The problem with many current problems in politics is the problem of minority. The current social-dynamics can not handle a constant movement of thought process, or in other words, the consensus moves too slowly to follow the dialectic. Despite that I find the idea of 'minority' and 'legistlating laws to protect them or such regular legal process' an orthogonal solution to the very problem. People are often educated to recognize the minority, but not the constant existence of different kinds of outliers.  

Outliers have no homeland. Nor are outliers affilated with anything. Just as how absurd and crudely rational the modern conception of nation-states and borders are. The mechanism of market is not that different from the institutions of state, regarding to its treatment of outliers.

## The masses adapt their morals when the outliers are in power

- The innovators are outliers. 
- The rich are outliers. They do not obey the rules. 
- The history is shaped by outliers. (not workers) 
- The masses always want to shame the outliers because they don't obey a norm, yet the rich oppress them.
- The masses preach property laws yet the outliers rig the markets. They see it as just. 

There is always exception to rules which the masses constantly follow and many genuinely believe in the justness that they are forced to follow the rules. Rules however, always come with exceptions, the regulators themselves, and the rich. The masses turn a blind eye to such facts. I have met some communists online and they seem to believe in a revolution by the masses, for which I later found some excellent rebuttals. 

Identify the causally important elements towards a causal goal, effect or consequence. The history is always shaped by outliers. If there are mass movements, it's usually initiated by a few people, or sparks of thoughts from a few people. It would be massively fallacious to attribute the change to the masses. Innovators are, by tautology, outliers.  

## The majority deserve the treatment

Outliers exist? Does that mean we ought to abandon our fruitful constructs of reason over categories, or in other words, the immensely useful generalizations? No, never.

History has made two biggest mistakes, the grave generalization committed by fascists and communists, with their overwhelming mass movements. The other mistake is a total renunciation of generalizations, in favor of a reckless equality.

The majority deserve their treatment. The outliers are their own breed. 

## Kafka's socialism

- The eros are fragile (against modern hedonism)
- The collective is opppressive and alienating.
- The absurd and unexpected is endless in every corner. (against wholistic design)
- The absurd must be extinguished with human power
- The exact means to such socialism is left to readers. 

The socialism of last century was Kafkaesque. The next one shouldnt be. 

It's then imperative to think what should this whole theory of Kafkaism land in. The various ideologies of past century have been dealing with class struggle, production, races, various aspirations. Imminent development in the future can drastically change the goals we want to pursue. I'd want to anchor the thought onto something that will probably, persist into foreseeable future for a quite a long time. That the very goal of next socialism should target the problem of _Kafkaesque predicatement_ of individuals itself. 

Is socialism just about bread, or the production of material goods, or the triumph of a society maybe of some specific race? All of them will eventually fall into some sort of Kafkaesque dystopia in various corners unseen in the official propaganda. Think this idea as a pointer that points far into future, rather a specific prescription of the blueprint of a future socialism.

# Dialectics and classical logic

I've my own way of estimating my worth of thoughts. I value it when a new idea of mine challenges, or contradicts most mainstream thoughts. Such contradiction is based on ample contemplation of existing arguments, thus, a dialectical development. 

I had been having a very rich dialectical experience unaware, due to my posession of an internal monologue, which I found to be non existent for many people, later. The intuitive experience is like bumping back and forth across views, and each past view is a _dialectical step_, or _dialectic intermediate_. The term doesn't matter. On a tangent, I love expressing my thoughts with new terms each time, to show off that I actually understand them unlike many organic LLMs that live on the internet, and in my city.

This view, a temporal, longitudinal view of progression of ideas, such as your own understanding of some particular thing, casts a shadow on every moment of my thinking, because I know they are dialectic intermediates, incomplete, imperfect. 

This may sound like truism. I agreed so too, until I became very explicitly aware of such a process. The depiction of it as a truism, is also drawn as parallel to a thought that was traditional in Chinese culture. [Lu Xun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Xun) called it 中庸的，调和的 which shares great similarity to the laymen interpretation of dialectics. The dialectics taught in Chinese universities is false too. 

> Every thought is a bit right, and every thought is a bit wrong. Truism, platitude?

There is no useful knowledge that can be drawn from this sentence, without knowing the full theory of dialectics. It may serve some useless skepticism and as a weapon in bad-faith debates, though. 

I used the state-machine model a lot. The benefit of drawing compsci concepts is that they are easy to communicate, and usually non ambiguous.

Dialectic logic is like the whole state machine, with the axis of time included, while classical logic, deals with every snapshot, ie, every state. 

To understand classical logic, I recommend a tour through the tutorials of [Lean4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4). Don't be scared of theorem provers like I was. They are really just, theorem, provers.

Lean4 captures the entirety of classical logic, with its powerful type system.

1. Classical logic does not care what the terms mean
2. Classical logic is a language
3. Classical logic is closed, hermetic, and does not care about its 'external world'

This is my definition of classical logic, or, if it differs from mainstream definition, this is what I believe it should mean. 

When you reason through classical logic, the system is based off a fixed set of axioms, and all conclusions, facts drawn are enclosed within this system. All terms are well-defined to be a fixed place within the system. You can even feed the whole system into a machine to check for correctness of a proof, which does not understand the terms like a human. 

1. Terms do not need to have a semantic meaning
2. Terms have fixed, non ambiguous meanings within the system, for this definition of _meaning_.
3. Temrs do not need to correspond to reality. ie, it does not need to deal the problems implicated in _corrspondance theory of truth_

The entire modern STEM is based on classical logic. 

When you reason through, alone or with an interlocutor, using dialectics, the terms are refined, changed, throughout the discourse. That does not mean we can not have stable definitions of terms. It is rather what we want through such a discourse, to gain a better understanding, attached to symbols. 

Definitions are absolutely stable regarding numbers, for example, _within the system of calculus_. You might argue against saying how much thoughts appear when you think of numbers and new thoughts arise etc, but, well, I am specifically referring the idea of numbers, _within its system of calculus_.  `Idea(numbers as a general idea) ∩ Idea(the number's calculus)`


# The dialectic imperative

There are notable ideas that can be drawn from dialectics. 

Such as that I can define reason to be a continual dialectical progression. 

A moral duty to dialectically progress one's thought. 

Civil covenants based on dialectics instead of simply 'free speech', and fixed contracts of 'private property'. 

In light of Kafka's thought, I think dialectics is the perfect response. Each possible Kafkaesque situation is a thought awaiting to be integrated into the dialectic machine. The estrangement is exactly what happens when the rest of society do not try to consider the bizarre situation someone is going through.

The _correct_ worldview should maximally integrate thoughts into the dialectic-state-machine where each of them meaningfully push the whole understanding forward, intuitively, a greater picture. By thoughts I mean all the possible future scenarios, all the possible past scenarios, no matter how bizarre; all possible ideas, no matter how forbidden they are, how much they upset you, how counter intuitive they seem.

# Algebraic theory of politics

To algebra, means to abstract out details. That's not all. It's the matter of building a theory based on a foundation of abstractions, which is typically seen in abstract algebra. 

To build a good algebraic theory, it needs a good pick of fundamental elements. And to justify such algebraic theories, I refer to the above elaboration about how both classical logic and dialectics coexist and stay true. 

An algebraic theory is based on a set of abstract elements, which correspond to axioms in classical logic. That is to say, an algebraic theory is hermetic, closed, and perpetual. An algebraic theory should avoid referencing things in real world without explicit awareness, such that the theory forms a coherent language that does not need to deal with language-reality correspondence. 

## Intentionality and mechanisms

There are only 2 elements that participate in a political system, the intentionality, and the mechanisms that follow various sources of intentionality due to their subservient nature. This forms the basis of my radically different view on politics.

Market is defined by a vector of wealth over all individuals, where the ranks of power are determined by their relative wealth, which is simplest among all systems, in isolation. In comparison to this view of politics, the various political ideologies are somewhat obfuscating the nature of political dynamics. There is, for example, no inherently evil market because market is subservient to the combination of legal regulation and the investors the customers, both are sources of intentionality, which can be directly derived from this theory. This is therefore the 1st point that can be derived to refute a common view that market is inherently evil or some simply call it capitalistic, or phrased in more vague ways.

This framework can be very useful in analyzing immediate problems that exist today, at least. Consider all the systems that may be designed, it's logically inevitable within each one there are sources of intentionality and a massive amount of mechanisms where people have to follow a certain pattern of behavior. Then, it's only relevant to have better sources of intentionality in these systems. 

Do sources of intentionality have anything to do with particular mechanisms such as markets or planning? They don't. 

> I will call sources of intentionality as intention origins from now on

Consider an existing system with bad intention origins, how do you expect good behaving (such as morally good) intention origins to arise? The corrupt people in power would prevent that, _by tautology_. It's therefore a prerequisite that a system have benign intention origins, rather than what most current political theoriests try to do, ie, endlessly analyzing mechanisms and consider politics to be a science of mechanisms, ignoring the persistance, and precedence, the causal importance of intention origins. 

## Abstract algebra of power

> Politics and economy

Following the method of abstract algebra, lets define some axiomatic elements of the algebra

- Absolute Money, as a form of power that has no strings attached.
- Will, any kind of intention that is powerless without money.
    - There is conflict, between wills.
- Absolute violence is conceptualized as an extreme form of power where the outcome of event _A_ is forcefully made by some will against other will. 
    - The violence can come from nature, state, or regular people.
    - Money is a stateful construct upon this notion, which faciliates the theory.
- Willed Money. Role powers in institutions, legal powers, academic, corporate credentials, status. The acquirement of such money and exercising their power requires conformity to a specific will. 
    - Legal money, which is a common form of willed money, close enough to absolute money, but mainly subject to taxation and various fees.
    - Property is what a free will can dispose of, with total sovereignty.
        - Asset is a form of property that generates money, where in its purest form, pure asset. Pure asset generates money without the owner conforming to any other will such as in the way of labouring.
        - Inalienable property, those things that are tied to free will, for all practical purposes, such as looks and intellect, which can not be directly traded yet.
- Gains, defined as a function over a particular will. Absolute money produces equal, net gains for every free will, by tautology. This gives absolute money a special conceptual status of _pure utility_
- Loss is defined as negative gains. 

The willed money, is hence, a 'linear combination' of the former two algebraic constructs. 

Under this framework, only the net profit of a corporate, or disposable income of a person can count as 'legal money', as the rest of money is subject to will of clients, not of their own, having strings attached.

The modern system has a vast collection of willed money, each serving a different goal. 

Out of all kinds of willed money, legal money, aka currency, is most liquid, easily tradeded due to their structural simplicity. Different kinds of money are interexchanged which is enabled by a matter of configuration of current reality.

# Null hypothesis on the nature of conscious identtiy 

There is a stance that I have been having that is analogous to the null hypothesis, but applied in the realm of _personal philosophy_, as in the philosphy of dealing with one's own outlook on life and personal identity. 

The null stance simply states that, nothing other than the consciouness itself is assumed to be part of the self, yourself, or myself. That none of the surroundings, be it my race, the assignment the parents I got, my nation, is assumed, is taken for granted. It's simply absurd to me to assume that the things are a part of myself for no apparent reason, which underpins a vast array of modern ideologies. They assume too much about their identity, yet most elements about their identity is arbitrary, randomly chosen at birth. 

I only found out the need to write this down because it turned out this is not an idea that many share with me, as opposed to what I previously assumed.

# Wisdom and intellect

I take a computer science approach to explain the difference between wisdom, and intellect. 

Consider a function `Sha256(x)=y`, wisdom is the knowledge of `x`, while intellect, is the ability to reverse the function. 

Apparently in this case it's computationally impossible. This is more on the side of immediate knowledge or information, so, extrapolate `x` to be a some specific way of thinking, specific habits of dealing with things, specific configuration of assumptions (mindset) before any more information is available, a specific worldview. 

It's therefore possible for a computationally inferior agent to _outwit_ a more computationally powerful agent through the _wisdom_, which in the above case, is taken to extreme. Substitute _outwit_ with _outcompete_ in other aspects such as achieving certain noble goals if you need.

Getting substantially more intellect is generally impossible for a human being, but wisdom is not bounded. 

In the causal path to truth-seeking, there are the only two elements, information and compute. Saying that also implies there is a substantial element of information, which enables low-compute agents to massively outpace superior agents with the help of good information. Good information can be, knowledge of a better algorithm, which may reduce complexity from `O(n^2)` to `O(logn)`, while compute is close to average for most human beings by tautology.

This is also, how the right prompt can make LLMs 'much smarter' because we are giving it some 'knowledge' that is on a very high metacognitive level. In an analogy, the AI was running on a `O(n)` algorithm and the prompt we gave them is some sort of `O(logn)` method of thought.

# Pareto front, multi variate, multi objective optimization

I have to name this method of thought, as in, it as a gadget that I often pick up to frame my ideas, to analyze things, the notion of Pareto front, a recurring theme throughout my recent stream of thought.

Then going meta again, it's sometimes more preferable to write down _gadgets of thoughts_, rather than try to come up with gigantic, systematic theoretical works.

Many problems of real world are often over-simplified, such as the concern on privacy, the advocate of privacy. Many would want a single piece of software that is specialized in protecting the user's privacy, yet the problem itself is actually a multi-objective optimization over _actual usability_ and _privacy_. Speaking of usability, I would, as usual, ground it in very immediate phenomena, that the user actually makes friends through a privacy-enhanced device, or software, or platform, that the solution in question is actually increasing the rate of the usability, which is the _phenonemal account of usability_. This can be said for many other problems that most of them are multi-objective optimization, instead of what they seem to be single-objective which many assume so.

# Dialectical freedom, as opposed to constitutional free speech or paradox of tolerance

There is a practical and dire need for a better idea that is drafted to substitute for constitutional free speech or paradox of tolerance, be it a mode of moderation in a small community, or society at large. Not like I really count on this to be implemented, but it's the idea I would propose if there needs to be one, at all. 

The "or" in the section title does not imply a parallelism. Speaking of their parallelism, it lies in the fact that they are both being pushed, thus constituting my use of "or".

On a tangent, there are infinitely many ideas being pushed. For each one of the idea, I suggest a dichotomal split, as a starting point of thought, that an idea is not just an idea in public, but the _idea de jure_ and the _idea in effect_. It would be utterly fallacious to just treat the idea as they are pushed, much as I do not just take what a person says, I observe what he does.

The idea of free speech always falls short when it gets implemented in online communities, because there is an infinitude of nuance that is not captured in a simple code of 'free speech'. The particularities remain non-rationalized and people mostly only focus on that simple _code_ or _covenant_ of free speech.

The matter is to treat politics and social system as a whole, as a conversation, a dialogue, a rational process. 

Analogously to free speech, we can forbid what blocks the dialectical progress, and intentionally promote what drives the dialectic forward. In practicse this is very similar to what 'code of free speech' will effect in. 

- Spam (valid under free speech, invalid under dialectical freedom as it blocks reasoning)
- Slurs (valid under free speech, invalid under certain code of tolerance, valid under dialectical freedom as long as its not spam)
- Violence (blocks dialectical progress)
- Property (blocks dialectical progress as it blocks the liberty of people who can effect change)

# Retrospective chronological view on life

I have tried to rationalize my past which does provided me with useful insights, including, personality development analyzed from the whole trajectory of life.

Here is another thing first. Life can be generally seen as a series of steps of a backtracking solver. This is, a specific observation over a pattern that is visible in my own life. That is to say, and that I believe, it might not apply to other people as directly. 

The steps mainly consist of super goals and going into sub goals. When sub goals fail or are postponed I retract to super goals, which, at this very moment, triggers a very existential process of _goal revaluation_. And I would like you to focus on this motion. This picture as I am positing here, is not useless, which for myself I would try to remind myself of that too to be aware of this general process to not be carried away by sub goals. When it gets retracted all the way back to origin, it's called an existential crisis. Here, this forms a very substantial definition of the elusive idea.

# You should gain confidence by recognizing the finitude of your time and reasoning power

Two ways can it go

- I am lay person who has finite time and reasoning effort, so I must follow textbooks and governments
- I am lay person who is rationally bounded, so I should favor my _pet theories_ despite their possible unsoundness, because they are trustworthy. 

It is only after I realized my finitude in time that I can not read all books over philosophy that I developed more confidence in my own theories. 

And, ontologically, all theories are fundamentally pet theories. There is no valid distinction when the logical framework can be arbitrary.

Let me call it _transcendental humility_

# The most valuable thoughts are those that have never been put into words

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy) relevant

I find it utterly absurd that a huge number of people would read books (most prominently marxist books and christian scriptures), who comprosise a large portion of the modern political debate, and adhere to them strictly, and shun others for not knowing the said books. They barely think themselves. 

The most valuable thoughts are those that have never been put into words. The whim you get after some internal expedition, which surprised you so much that you immediately know that you have never felt this before, a brilliant new idea not present in the common vocabulary of the discourse at large or your own vocabulary. 

The real philosopher pulls theories out of thin void, utter void. The salesmen digest it and rebrand them for their own gains. 

On the dialectic side of justification, language gets gradually refined, aka, modified, adapated as the discourse goes, which is considered progress. Such radical ideas are logically a greater kind of dialectical progress.

# Guide to newborns

Prospective chronology suitable for reading by newborns.

- You are born in a random country, random family, given a name that you never chose yourself. 
- You are compelled to accept this body, the race, the culture that comes associated with it, the legal and social contracts of the country you live in. 
- You are forced into a prison-like education system. 0.1% of people did not make it. They killed themselves. 
- You are born into an abusive, poor family. 1% of people didn't make it.
- You are met with an accident, 40% people in similar conditions did not make it.
- Your unluck pile together, 70% of people in similar situations did not make it. 
- You have entered the Kafka territory, where the pain can not be communicated and all the feelings have to be pocketed, merely due to the sheer absurdity of the situation itself.
    Your ideas lead to ridicule, or even persecution if you try to express them.
