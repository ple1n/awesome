= Outline of architecture of the next-generation distributed internet

Hereby I present the most urgent concerns, the answers to the questions at large, the groundworks of future protocols, the axiomatization of adversarial models.

- The problems with P2P style protocols
- The problems with Fediverse and why I can do better
- The optimal usage of 'blockchains' without turning it into a financial scam
- The problem you might not even know. How can a distributed net be prepared for GFW and such threats.
- The need for a ZK-driven reputation system

= Opportunistic consensus

A system that can work when consensus can be obtained, and when it is inaccessible.

The system maintains consistent behavior. The withdrawal of consensus does not break the system according to a certain definition of 'breaking'

A system that can work with multiple sources of consensus.

*A consensus is defined as*, from the perspective of obtainer, with a given *seed data*, with finite steps, a globally unique state can be obtained, with regard to a time point (physical time, assuming Minkowski spacetime), in material reality. $f(t)=s$

$
  CC "from the obtainer" : ("Seed","Procedure",t) -> C(t):=s_t
$

The notable difference from typical algorithmic paper is that it involves physical time as an inherent, important, part of the description.

This definition involves material reality, which means it's not a construct that only involves abstract ideas.

This is a practical definition, that is to say, we don't care how it is achieved. We don't talk about consensus mechanisms. We talk about effects, the probability that such consensus fails, etc. This is the power of algebraic reasoning.

Blockchains match this definition, while web-of-trust systems don't. Wot heavily depend on parameters that vary by person. Blockchain only requires a genesis block as seed data.

This notion is formulated because the stronger system, always-consensus, is, practically speaking after this much surveying, hard to implement given goals stated below.

$
  CC_b:cases(
    S="genesis block",
    P="getting blocks and verifying",
    t="desired time of interest"
  )
  ->C(t) \
  CC_b "holds for all observers"
$

Now, here is the analysis of web-of-trust

$
  CC_w:cases(
    S="some people I found trustworthy from random community",
    P="getting relevant data",
    t="desired time of interest"
  )
  ->C(t) \
  CC_w "can vary greatly due to choice of "S
  "resulting in divergence of" C(t)
$

Some people may suggest that an alternative $C_1$ is, rather _the_ correct consensus.

No I am not postulating that $C$ is subjective, as that contradicts the definition. The definition represents an algorithm that reaches a consensus _per se_, regardless of observer.

So in WoT model, some believe its acceptable that there exist a pool of consensus, where each person can reach one, which is believed, to better suit him.

= Eventual consistency

An eventual consistent system reaches agreement when a node receives all the messages that have been sent.

The system consists of states, where each $s$ has an _equality relation_ defined by the system.

There exists a _partial order_, such that $forall s_1, s_2 exists s_3 >=s_1 and s_3>=s_2$, which is called a _join_

$
  Sigma=(S,=,>=,"join",Delta)
$

In a grow-only set, two nodes having divergent sets can exchange messages, \ and reach a _join_ = $A union B$

A grow-only set is isomorphic to $NN$ on eventual consistency $Sigma$

$
  U="all possible set elements"\
  S subset.eq U\
  >=' := supset.eq \
  "join" :=A union B \
  Delta subset.eq U
$

Typical chat protocols, without central server intervention, like Matrix, are not eventually consistent

Chat protocols tend to adopt a directed acyclic graph where nodes are signed messages with receipt of earlier messages.

A join is only possible when a message that merges all branches exist. Alternatively, redefine _equality_, or produce virtual states.


Is it possible to construct a distributed data structure, and reduce finding the join, to be a search problem.

Or structure it such that, after receiving $a$ states, a `max` can be guaranteed.

$
  t "for epoch, an interval of physical time as in physical reality" \
  e=(t,s) \
  "For" t' ,max_(forall e(t=t',s))(s) =>"the consensus at" t'
$

We can adopt an empirical constraint of $max$.

Blockchains do not satisfy this requirement, ie, lack of absolute finality. They can only constrain it by threat of slashing.

== Absolute finality

$
  S_t={e | (t',s) and t'=t} \
  exists max(S_t)
$

If $S_t$ is finite and unchanging, $max(S_t)$ is a constant. It can not represent a state.

If $S_t$ is infinite, $max(S_t)$ does not exist.

We must make $max(S_t)$ encode a state we want to convey.

=== Honest signaler assumption

The signaler may release any message from the set, $s' in S_t$

We model observer as a node with state $S_o subset.eq S_t$

$
  S("Current state") = max(S_o)
$

Can we make $max(S_t)$ dependent on $S_o$. This may encode a useful state, but observers may not converge due to difference in $S_o$

==== The trivial case of $NN$ counter

The signaler may release any $n in NN$

$
  exists.not max(NN)
$

The observers take $max(S_o)$. No shrinkage of $S_t$ can be expected.

=== Finite state transducer

If the observers can be modelled as FSTs, an output string would be produced after finite reception of messages. The state changes are the messages, in the order of hash-chain order.

$|S_t|$ decreases as $|S_o|$ increases

=== First message wins

For $t_1$, a protocol can define the first message from the signaler to be accepted as consensus, because $|S_t|=1$ and _by honest signaler assumption_.

This is, however, not that useful.

I should revise the assumption. In many cases, there is the the _reversion attack_. A key gets stolen and it's used to reverse a consensus.

This can be easily done, with a _state oracle_

+ An authoritative server
+ State proofs from some blockchain

=== re-Formalization of the hashed DAG

Nodes are messages, which are often state deltas, and _ultimately_ represent states.

Links based on cryptographic hashes are proofs of _temporal/causal precedence_

DAG is a set of states with a partial order. Note that this comes with something beyond math. The block linked by another block can only be created, first.

== Branching attack / Reversion attack

The central problem in the state synchronization turned out to be branching.

$S_o$ is defined to be the internal belief of a node about some state.

Theoretically, after $t_1$ passed, State before $t_1$ shouldn't change anymore, by definition.

The node may ignore further messages that change the past state, but new nodes can be "deceived".

The only solution to branching attack is "coercion", or "will" that complies with the protocol

For coercion, blockchain offers most coercion, and it can be very efficient.

A blockchain with 1M dollars at stake can handle infinite amount of state.

For will, you can use a "trust" based mechanism to pick _complying_ sources.

Consider a blog that has one signer and is stored as a DAG. The blogger is benign to himself, ie, he doesn't attack his own blog.

One day he lost his key. The attack erases the entire blog by signing an alternative branch with empty content.

The two branches are inherently non-comparable states. Old nodes can ignore the new message, but new nodes get deceived.

The simple solution is to, finalize every blog change to a blockchain, ie. include the blog state in the blockchain state root.

Now, to attack a small blog the attacker has to go against the entire blockchain.

Isn't this cost-efficient?

Further, we can see that blockchains with more \$ in stake and more decnetralization are more trustworthy. We can publish state hashes to multiple chains, and when we check for results, they are weighed according to the trustworthiness calculated by the-above-justifications, as a weighed voting.

== Review blockchain state proof candidates

Recalling from meory, there are a few

- ZK proofs that simply prove entire chain of state transitions up from genesis, eg. Mina.
- Multi-signatures from the quorum, eg. Ethereum.
  - I couldn't find the post. Anyway it was about having Eth stakers sign a state root, such as signature is enough because the production of a false signature is deterred by slashing.

Notice that blockchain state proofs do not need any additional communication. They can be verified within the contract.

#set quote(block: true)

#quote(attribution: [https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/building-helios-ethereum-light-client/])[
  The consensus layer light client conforms to the beacon chain light client specification, and makes use of the beacon chainâ€™s sync committees (introduced ahead of the Merge in the Altair hard fork). The sync committee is a randomly selected subset of 512 validators that serve for ~27-hour periods.

  When a validator is on a sync committee, they *sign* every beacon chain block header that they see. If more than two-thirds of the committee signs a given block header, it is highly likely that that block is in the canonical beacon chain. If Helios knows the makeup of the current sync committee, it can confidently track the head of the chain by asking an untrusted RPC for the most recent sync committee signature.
]

https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/light-clients/

Eth state proofs are probably sub-optimal. They need to download a sequence of committee changes.

For https://argumentcomputer.github.io/zk-light-clients/ethereum/components/eth_nodes.html I dont think they provide proof servers.

With Mina only a few tips of branches need to be verified.

https://github.com/openmina/openmina

This chain uses a VRF and PoS, which means the stakers should produce the longest chain.

But we don't want to keep all nodes syncing Mina chain.

When a user posts something on Freenet2, he includes the hash into a Mina transaction. The network generates a state proof. The user attaches the proof to the post, and a ZK proof or a merkle path showing his hash is included, to prove that the post is made at a specific time point.

The user may also forge a state proof that is not on the canonical chain. In this case, anyone can post a Mina state proof into this Freenet2 contract, which takes down the post (or simply marks the timestamp as fraudulent).

This is the stateproof-challenge approach.

=== Mina

Mina is the ideal model of blockchain for illustration . The central task of a blockchain is to do fork selection. The way blockchain does it, involves two kinds of scarcity. The voting power scarcity encoded in genesis block, and temporal scarcity.

Re-cap the fundamental way blockchain works.

#import "@preview/fletcher:0.5.8" as fletcher: diagram, node, edge

#diagram(
  node-stroke: 1pt,
  spacing: 4em,
  node((0, 0), $arrow(phi) = "initial votes"$, radius: 5em),
  edge((0, 0), (2, 0), `state change`, "-|>"),
  node((2, 1), $"votes"=beta$, radius: 5em),
  edge((0, 0), (2, 1), "-|>"),
  node((2, 0), $"votes"=alpha \ arrow(phi)=arrow(phi)_1$, radius: 5em),
  edge("-|>"),
  node((4, 0), `s3`, radius: 5em),
)

The reference for voting power is kept in "previous state" right before transition, and each fork can have an associated vote calculated.

For any specific point in time, finality is only reached when a fork is the fork with the most votes that can ever be constructed.

If the threshold is set to be 50%, it doesn't guarantee finality because the other 50% can collude and genrate an alternative fork.

Denote total power as $1$, If we set threshold to be $sigma$, the rest $1-sigma$ can collude.

When such collusion is excluded we say it reaches finality according to this standard of security.

Throwing away this definition, we can get a probablistic finality when the temporal scarcity is involved.

We know count the votes of a fork by the total votes accumulated from the genesis to the tip.

The VRF in Mina probablistically make the longest chain to be authored by people with most stake (voting power).

There is no threshold here. With any number of forks, all forks can be sorted by the amount of votes.

And we can take the fork with higest votes. We make sure the tip is right before "current time".

With this _timely assumption_, we can make sure it's the most voted fork because another more voted fork can not possibly exist.

This very strict definition is not true for Mina because it doesn't use a Verifiable Delay Function.

This ultimate kind of finality is only possible with a verifiable delay such as proof of work (but bad impl).


== TODO: How do contracts use them

- Contracts can use them by themselves, indenpdently.
  - I should write some lib for this.
- Aggregate them to save gas fee on chain?

A contract can be seen as a state machine with possibly branching state changes.

#import "@preview/diagraph:0.3.4": raw-render

#raw-render(```dot
digraph {
  s_1 -> {s_2 s_3}
  s_3 -> s_4
}
```)

The basic way to use blockchain for _state pinning_, is to publish the state root onto a chain immediately after posting, to prove its timestamp.

This is very rudimentary. Does not require any on-chain logic, but only uses the chain as a witness of time.

Much more can be done, ofc.

In comaprison, L2 solutions batch states changes and post the proofs of the transitions on chain, so that they can be used on chain. This is unlike L2. We use the chain as an external service.

Decoupling the chain has benefits, we can use any chains as the _timestamp witness_, any chains as microtransaction handler.

== The new form of L2, Freenet2 with blockchain-state fraud proofs

There are 3 major forms L2 right now, specificlly on Ethereum

+ ZK-rollups
+ Fraud-proofs
+ ZK-rollups with fraud proofs

But they are all centered around one blockchain, acting as an extension and enhancement of the blockchain.

Here the new form of using blockchain centers around an application protocol

- Nodes are not required to constantly gossip about new blockchain state updates
- Users do not need to look for RPC servers like what you have to do with Ethereum, or Monero (if you don't run a full node)
  - In the case of Monero it's hard to find connectable nodes even. This form of L2 just has much more superior decnetralization

We consider a scalable distributed network to be a ring of nodes (informally) where nodes from different locations tend to keep different part of the states of the network.

When a post is made, it's posted onto Mina chain, and a state proof is generated. The network hosts many such state machines. Only when new content is pushed shall a state machine is updated.

Very infrequently a post is found to have a fraudulent state proof, a witness node broadcasts a new chain-state-proof which by itself takes down such posts, because Mina consensus logic should handle this.

= Web of trust

We characterise blockchains as innately trustworthy agents that follow the protocol, with the nuance that, they vary in degrees of reliability.

- If, say, a blockchain has stakeholders that are in secret collusion. They can collectively defy the protocol. The goal of the field has therefore been optimizing towards a state apparatus where all the members know nothing but to follow the protocol.
  - Culminating in Nullchinchilla's https://melproject.org/en/

Hereby, we define blockchain as an institution, wherein members are reduced to cogs and rules prevail, which as a whole is an _agent_ with some will, some expected behavior to outsiders.

The other _orthogonal_ perspective is to not make innately _aligned agents_ with regard to our goals.

The story starts from that when you use a usual web service, you trust a single corporate operator, which they call a single point of failure.

Going up the metacognitive hierarchy we know it's only conceptualized as a single operator, but in reality it's under the influence of internal corporate employees and various dynamics.

== Alignment

Analysis has shown that all of that is ultimately directed towards _alignment_. We want a blockchain to follow a protocol; we want trusted CA roots in our browser to act "honestly".

Either by coercion or voluntary alginment from the other side, it's going to be done.

The society constantly does a web-of-trust thing, the credit ratings, the connections underlying business world, the bureaucracy of tangible state.

Consider, in the new social platform, you have a list of subscribed news channels. You maintain the list to kick out "malicious sources" that publish ADs, etc.

As a form of decision making

- You may adopt information from other trusted agents, to efficiently remove more malicious sources
  - which forms the graph structure of web-of-trust

As a state apparatus

- You coerce people into behaving to your liking, ie, _alignment_ by the threat of unfollowing.
- You maximize coercion by forming coalition with other people
  - which necessitates the graph structure
- Like any state apparatus, web-of-trust is self-prophetic.

Hereby I pointed out the metacognitive underpinnigs of the seemingly innocent idea of web-of-trust.

=== Avenues of improvement

The part of coercion can be furthered by forming a larger governance structure where a ban happens decisively. Sure, this institution can go corrupt, or undesirable as in my views.

There is a lot that can be done to engineer a better _institution_ in this realm of computation.

- Anonymous voting that is decentralized
- Anonymous voting with more complex voting mechanisms

== Law of necessary solution

If a good, decentralized solution is not present, and a solution is demanded, people will opt-for whatever is available.

- People go to corporate-run platforms because socialization is a necessary demand.
- Matrix users run centralized ban-lists to keep out malicious actors

I disdain the centralized ban-lists due the above reasons. In any case, this section serves to warn you against ignoring any unsolved-demand. They can go in the ways you hate.

== Law of necessary existence

If you don't make an institution that removes CSAM, your protocol will face existential threat.

If you don't make an ideal, non-biased institution that removes CSAM, people will invent one themselves and it will probably be biased, corrupt, and centralized.

The problem of web-of-trust can therefore be divided into two goals, if you want to make an algorithm for them.

+ The algorithm and system to evaluate most trustworthy agents
+ The algorithm and system to _punish_ misbehaving agents

This may sound a bit weird to some but (2) is a necessary consequence of (1) as a matter of fact.

== On implementing Web of trust

I'd rather call it _Egoistic Alignment_. As illustrated above, this is _orthogonal_ to the cosntruct of blockchain, or consensus systems.

We consider a list of agents, and assign a probability of them behaving according to some _criterion_.

$
  Q={N=(rho,K)} \
  K "denotes the totality of knowledge we have about" N \
  rho = f(K) "we derive the probability of the node well behaving from" K
$

We don't need to constraint ourselves to some specific models of estimation. Why not make use of everything possible to estimate better metrics.

Necessarily, the user agent (the node which the user runs, acts on behalf of the user and represents the user on the network), has beliefs (about what is spam, etc.)

I model it with beliefs, rather than decisions because this notion makes transitive trust easier to model. And it connects with probability theory directly.

$
  B_"elief" (P_"roposition") in [0,1] \
  "we use probability theory directly, which is equivalent to fuzzy logic" \
  Q={N=(rho:P->P_N,K,B)} \
  "B is the probability the node believes about P" \
  "we calculate a probability about a node's trustworthiness about the specific belief" \
  rho(B) "therefore means" N "being right about" P \
  B "is what" N "asserts the probability about it" \
  B=(sum_(N in Q) rho(P) times B_N ) / (|Q|) \
  "this is the weighted average approach, maybe there are better" \
  "recusrively, we can estimate the proposition, a node being well-behaving with the function"
$

There are 2 metrics to quantify the performance

- The differnentiating power of the model. Beliefs should have large differences, but not overestimating.
- The amount of nodes that can be included in the model.

$
  rho (P)=(sum_(N in Q) rho(rho(P)) times B_N (rho (P)) ) / (|Q|) \
$

Recursive functions are seen, but the logic model requires definite values, so it's a constraint satisfication problem.

Anyway, this is a general framework based on philosphical foundation that works with arbitrary functions.

This is a system of constraints that are developed from logic and probability theory. We can reasonably show that a valid estimator must satisfy the constraints, but a specific algorithm is not given; such is the power of algebra.

== Provable Quoting

Sometimes I want to quote messages from a person. If it's done with a screenshot, It can not prove the existence of messages.

Trivially, a proof can be generated with ZKP

== Commited messages

You can send a message that is revealed in the future. In the interim you can not change it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme

== Timecapsule

You can send safe timecapsules into future wihtout relying on an central message keeper.

== Case analysis: A service offering anonymous exits

Exits can be abused. When abuse happens they lose a huge portion of value because they got blacklisted from web services.

It's not just about payment. There is an intrinsic, and huge, component of trust.

We want it to be

- Sufficiently anonymous, since it's a system for, eg. paid Tor exits.
  - This part can be done with ZK.
- Sufficiently enforcing. We want to minimize abuse.

I can see there is a fundamental difference in assumption of identity in an _anonymous trust system_

Note, If you want to survery the literature, the search words would be

- "modelling trust in distributed systems"
- "reputation systems"
- "bayesian web of trust", etc.

The analysis presented above has cyclic probability which is probably computation intractable. I expect existing literature to be a simplification of my analysis.

They tend to assume a continual, pseudo-anonymous identity, where each of them has a track history of behavior. Pseudo-anonymity links online activity together, which is a compromise of anonymity.

If, we can transform a picture of total-anonymity trust data into pseudo-anonymity trust data, we can input it into well-studied trust models.

== Formalization. Totally-Anonymous Trust System

The whole process preserves an anonymity of $n in N$ anonymity set, if we consider the simple, anonymity set conception of anonymity level.

Identity Initialization $arrow$ Activity $arrow$ (end)

The process is cheap, and a user may make a new identity for every post he makes.

#highlight([The trust system may publish some data for the Initialization as long as it doesn't weaken the anonymity]). Equivalently, we can say the system maintains a state.

Typically, the trust system publishes a ZK-proof according to its protocol needs. Again, the information revealed preserves the anonymity level.

The Initialization must provide enough information/proof for other agents to calculate his trust scores.

There are indeed papers on ZK and anonymous reputation systems. Engineering-wise, we should prefer writing ZK-algorithms in a ZK VM. Prefer existing ZK frameworks over equivalent but manually written cryptosystems. Prefer composing existing gadgets and using frameworks.

The state-of-art ZK systems are more performant than stated in most papers.

https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-eigentrust/blob/master/docs/4_algorithm.md

We can rewrite this in latest iter of ZKVM.

https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/eigentrust.pdf

=== Attempt 1

We may consider each pseudo-anonymous identity to be a collection of unlinkable, anoymous identities.

For each operation directed at a pseudo-nym, we replace it with a vector of anonyms.

$
  "Proving ownership of a pseudo-nym" -> "Proving ownership of a vector of anonyms"
$

I will try using this idea to port existing Trust models. EigenTrust produces the same global values for every peer. The simple idea is to use ZK-membership proofs to prove membership in buckets of high-ranking anonyms.

In other words, it's equivalent to proving that "you made a post that has among top 10K-100K in upvotes, and you made a project that is among top 1K to 10K by stars, and ..." which means, proving a pseudo-anonym is treated as a conjunction of anonyms.

If we can obtain a same vector (for every node) of trust scores in $NN$, we prove $k$ memberships in $k$ buckets that have high trust scores. This reference vector simplifies the proving.

#quote([It should be emphasized that the pre-trusted peers are essential
  to this algorithm, as they guarantee convergence and break up ma-
  licious collectives. Therefore, the choice of pre-trusted peers is
  important. In particular, it is important that no pre-trusted peer be
  a member of a malicious collective. This would compromise the
  quality of the algorithm. To avoid this, the system may choose a
  very few number of pre-trusted peers (for example, the designers
  of the network). A thorough investigation of different methods of
  choosing pre-trusted peers is an interesting research area, but it is
  outside of the scope of this paper.])

I have not found a satisfying decentralized, anonymous, reputation system in the literature yet.

=== Limit the number of anonymous identities

We'd want the number of anonymous identities to be finite, and maybe rate-limited.

This is doable with ZK. In general producing a unique hash for every use of an anonym, and proving the lack of such hashes from a merkle tree.

TODO.


== Attempt 2, Formalization

We characterise a pseudo-anonyous identity, aka. _pseudonym_, as a continuous presence on Internet.

$
  "Pnym" = [s_1,s_2,s_3,dots] \
  "link"([s_n]) : "public" \
  "Token" = ("pubkey","signature")
$

$[s_n]$ are states published in public, where the link between them is also public. The token is used to prove identity.

It's a form of currency where any malicious behavior depreciates the "token" drastically and continual compliance is heavily rewarded.

For an _anonym_, the link is only known to the user.

$
  "Anym" = [s_1,s_2,s_3,dots] \
  "link"([s_n]) : "private" \
  "Token" = ("trapdoor"("secretkey"),"proof") \
  "each token is unlinkable, indistinguishable from other tokens"
$

Fundamentally we can be sure that, all models of reputation are mathematical manipulation of the available information. Everything not based on _information_ are guesses.

I don't think there is a need to fixate over a specific model, because anything that constructs such a currency should work.

In a typical reputation model, the $[s_1]$ is converted into $n in NN$, a score, where $s_n$ is a trade and the peer's rating about it. I consider this a loss of information.

Consider

$
  "Anym"=[s_1,s_2,dots,b_1,b_2,dots] \
  s_n "represents good things he has done" \
  b_n "represents bad things he has done" \
  "both are backed by state that exists in public"
$

To prove a good reputation, you construct a ZK-proof to show you have done many good things, and a exclusion proof of bad things.

=== Transitive trust without pseudonym

$
  "Pnym_rating"=f("pnym")->n
$

This is the typical way a peer expresses trust about other peers, but it doesn't work without continual identities.

In an anonymous system, the trust graph is built over $s_n$. The edges connecting identities (originally) are distributed over the states $s_n$.

This method just turns a psuedonym into many small pseudonyms. Is this good enough?

There is a lot of metadata leakage although it's splitted.

=== Ontology of Trust

The untrusted thing must be logically connected to something that is trusted in the first place. The logical connection is called *inference*. There is no way an untrusted thing can be trusted without a logical connection. ZKPs are "zero-trust" due to a complex construction of mathematics, which is in itself, rigorous logic.

The various reputation models emphasize 'transitive trust' because there is no other way to derive trust.

Whim: Is it possible to prove the logical inference, logical connection in zero knowledge

$
  "prove that" s "is a descendent of" a, b, c, dots, "in a trust graph, in zero-knowledge"
$

There is a lot of information leakage already?

In other words, it's trying to prove that "you should trust me because you trust X, Y, Z, and I am somehow related to X, Y, Z through some relationships that confer trust"

This can not be turned into a cryptocurrency problem either, because the value of trust coming from each node, is subjective and changing.

Does an anonym expressing endorsement for other $s_n$ (anonyms) compromise anonymity? If so, can we avoid this.

Can we construct a graph that is isomorphic, and make it public instead?

=== Anonymous graph isomorphism

We define a trust graph, where nodes are assigned trust values, directed edges represent conferring of trust.

$
  "CompTrust"(N) -> N' \
  "where" N "has nodes with 0 trust and" N' "has a trust assignment for every node"
$

Provenance of trust is done by proving the ownership of nodes. Think of each node as a publickey, provenance is showing a signature. In classical web-of-trust, each user owns one keypair, and proves trustworthiness by using publickey-cryptography.

We consider graph isomorphism that maps graph A to B, where one node may be mapped to multiple nodes, so that the trust relationships are obfuscated. We want it hard to reconstruct the orginial graph.

== Whim: a general scheme based on ZK and state machine


#import "@preview/fletcher:0.5.8" as fletcher: diagram, node, edge

  node((2, 0), `s2`, radius: 2em),
  edge(`zk1(pub2,t2)`, "-|>"),
  node((4, 0), `s3`, radius: 2em),
)


It's possible to construct a graph with ZK, precisely

$
  G=(N="States",E={("ZK-Circuit","Input")})
$

or alternatively

$
  G=(N="Input",E="States") \
  "for now I dont talk about this one"
$

etc.

Each $s_n$ represents a set of beliefs of trust. All $t_n$ are secret.

Make the user trust the initial state $s_1$ of the state machine, and every possible state following the execution.

The circuit in use should uphold the rule of 'transitive trust'. Thereby, each $s_n$ represents an accurate set of beliefs about trust.

Would this work? Seems like a good general construction.

When a user in the middle of the whole trust graph wants to express trust about some other users (as identified by posts), he produces ZK proofs of state changes, _from other nodes_ to the desired terminal state that reflects the change. Thereby hiding his expression of trust.

The said circuit should ofc require the user to prove its reputation, from that very state, so the user could produce the output state which includes his desired _transfer of trust_.

The scheme must provide a method to merge states, so one set of trust beliefs can be produced.

This system tends towards a minization of states kept on network, as they can be merged and eliminated.

== 2nd Iteration of the ZK-state-machine idea

This is a genreal construction of anonymity-preserving reputation systems, in a distributed setup.

This pro is that this construction is an arrangement of well-developed cryptographic primitive, ZKP, which makes it immediately actionable in development.

A blockchain-style consensus is not required, in this section.

Denote reputation state as $r_n$. The beliefs about reputation, to a node $N$ as $B_N$, where $B_N = "CalcTrust"("trusted"={r_n},G_"graph")$.

As we know there is a fundamentally sound rule that, belief has to be justified. A trust is a belief; therefore a trust must be justified (with some source).

In a special case, we can assume that when a believed-to-be reputable person endorses some other people, they are also believed-to-be reputable, which we call _transitive trust_.

A node on this network, collects $r_n$ as many as possible and change his trust beliefs gradually.

A node has a set of user-set pre-trusted reputation states ${r_n}$

A state transition function $t({r_n}) ->r'$ accepts multiple states, and produce one state.

A ZK-proof proves this transition, $z_t {"public-input"={t},"private-input"}$

There exists a _merge_ function that works over any two $r_1,r_2$ that follow a common ancestor $r_0$

Trivially, a merge can be proved in zero-knowledge, which itself is a new transition.

=== Accumulate trust through other means

Users may make posts with $"post"=("body","signature"=H(k_"ey"))$, such that _key_ can be later used to prove his ownership of this post.


=== Generation of endorsement

Any node resides within a potentially infinite graph of reputation.

An $r_n$ may be generated without a prior state. An $r_n$ can be (implicitly) generated from any post, which should assign the post author some reputation. This happens in early time a network.

This can even be regarded as a time of contesting. Upvotes to a post are attached with a $z_t$

In later times, there are commonly acknowledged ${r_n}$ so a new post can be attached with a transition proof with non empty ${r_n}$ input.

Lone nodes on the graph, are merged by transitions.

This seems even harder than a privacy-coin.

== Anonymity through equi-reputatble decoys

Instead of modelling state machine and popular states, we focus on individual reputation proofs.

- Positive reputation proof
  - Ownership of popular posts (by proving knowledge of $k_"ey"$)
  - External reputation sources
  - Proving authorship of any online activity, in general.
  - *Decoys*
    - That you are the author of either (repo1, repo2, repo3, ...)
- Negative reputation proof
  - That the sources are not re-used up to $n$ times
  - That the sources are not on blacklist $x,y,z$

This is not that anonymous, but at least we are not linking posts together with one publickey.

Decoys can be drawn in. An observer can simply take the least reputable source to evaluate the reputation score of this proof. Then, as a result, the prover may just pull in a lot of high reputable sources, to maximize the score, which in turn destroys his anonymity, because it can be inferred the least reputable source is authored by him.

The best strategy for the prover is to draw in those reputation scores that are probably similar, to any observer (scores are highly subjective nonetheless)

Rephrased:

- Positive reputation proof
  - Ownership of popular posts $P subset.eq P union "Decoy"$

The rule that each observers picks the lowest scoring set member is to prevent cheating.

The selection of decoys can leak information about local trust-beliefs.

This reputation proof model can generalize to arbitrary information, as long as the statement can be formulated in NP language.

= The Holy Grail of Anonymous Networking - NIAR

Throwing away the papers, let's start by axiomatic characterisation of the problem.

In classical mixnets, messages are bounced through at least 3 relays to delink sender IP and receiver IP. Trivially, the link can be recovered when the 3 relays collude. The 3 relays are randomly selected from a pool.

    the Non-Interactive Anonymous Router (NIAR) model, in which a set of N re-
    ceiving nodes wish to receive information from a set of N sending nodes, with
    all information passing through a central router. Anonymity in their model is
    defined to be the inability to link any sender to the corresponding receiver, even
    if the router and (up to N âˆ’ 2) various (sender, receiver) pairs are susceptible
    to attack by an (honest-but-curious1) adversary.

    Departing from all prior approaches, we propose a novel non-interactive abstraction called a

    transfer (OT) protocol (instantiations of which are known to exist
    under the DDH, QR and LWE assumptions [DGI+19,GHO20]).

    NIAR can serve as a non-interactive anonymous shuffler (NIAS), which shuffles n sendersâ€™ messages
    in a non-interactive manner, such that the messages become unlinkable to their senders

= On interop of Mixnets and DHT-based systems

DHT-based distributed nets involve approx. $log(n)$ lookups per entry, and the process is sequential. Mixnets come with large delay.

Denote

- One-way delay to a DHT node to be $t_d$
- One-way delay to a mixnet exit node to be $t_m$

We can consider $t_d=t_m=t$ on average for any node, because nodes of all distributed networks are typically uniformly distributed globally.

$
  T_1=(t_m+2t_d+t_m)+(t_m+2t_d+t_m) + ... "for" log(n) "times"
  = 2log(n) (t_m+t_d) = 4log(n)t \
  "proposed solution"
  T_2 =t_m + log(n)(2t_d) \
  "without mixnet:" T_0 = log(n)(2t_d)=2log(n)t
$

The solution is to have an exit node to execute a program that performs the requests on behalf of the user.

Either an exit node from a mixnet executes the program, or a node in the DHT executes the program.

This, the feature _proxied DHT lookup_, should apply to other situations that have high delay, like users in censored regions etc. I wonder if Freenet2 has it.

More generally, we could have _entry nodes_ in a DHT that specialize in lookups, as they reside in data centers which have low latency to all other locations on average.

= 3rd-Iter Reputation system

Since we can use arbitrary reputation system and keep anonymity, how about just throw in some AI.

requirements in mind:

- reasonable convergence globally, to make anonymity work; otherwise anonymouse users get too low of scores
- speed on cpu

= ZK-based moderation

Machine learning ran inside a ZK circuit. Demand such a proof when posting, or in the fraud-proof style.

Verifying a proof is usually fast enough but proving can be too slow. TODO.

The difference is we don't have that much of a gas problem like typical blockchains.

Yes an attacker can just infinitely fuzz the model, but it's not a problem when the model is good enough, specifically, consider CSAM detection

- False positive, some legal content is banned, which is a loss in posting freedom
- False negative, some illegal content passes filter resulting in a proof being generated, which risks taking down the nodes

It's possible to minimize both false detections to a point fuzzing is ok because by definition it gets fuzzed to a point its legal.

= Two places, two trust systems

The general social structure of the network, resembles typical chatrooms, ie, being a pool of competing chatrooms where each room has a dictatorship.

The typical chatroom has admins and moderators that are appointed and demoted at will. This unironically resembles a government, or more preceisely I would call, a state (apparatus).

The admin enforces his will, shapes the room to his liking through the moderation system.

What I propose here, is a trust system such as _EigenTrust_. The trust system extends the _will_ of the admin, as the system more effectively manages the promotion and demotion of moderators.

This is a brief and incomplete introduction on the political side of my ideas.

Contracts on freenet2, are storage locations on the network.

We can run a trust system in contracts, which reject bad posts before they even get stored.

I call this *objective-trust-system*, as they run independently on the network.

The other system is the *subjective* trust system, which can be more heavy weighted as it serves as an agent that reasons about all the available data, for the user, prioritzing users' preferences and beliefs, removes spam and also acts as a recommender system.

== EigenTrust

I implemented eigentrust in this repo. Here is the mathematical description.

$
  "let the graph be" G = (N,E) \
  |N| = n \
  M in FF^(n times n) \
  M "is the opinion matrix" \
  M:n->n->t "expressing a node's trust about another node" \
  V in FF^n "which is the trust vector" \
  V :n->t \
  V "represents a state of trust"
$

The basic operation is repeatedly calculating until it converges, usually under 2 iterations.

$
  V_2=phi(M^T) times V_1 \
  phi "normalizes the matrix which involves a vector of pre-trusted peers" \
  V_p in FF^n
$

To be precise, an EigenTrust system is completely defined by, which is its initial state.

$
  E=(V_0,M_0,V_p)
$

I deviate from the original paper because it is insecure and does not meet my standards.

The system does not operate over nodes as in human operator nodes, but, abstract nodes.

Model the system as a distributed state machine.

$
  E_0 = (V_0,M_0,V_p) -->_(M_n) E_n
$

Then we can use the previously illustrated ZK-state-machine anonymous reputation scheme. 

Such that we prove state change to the trust vector by applying permitted state changes.
