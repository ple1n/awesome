= Overview of design of Matrix-2

The _ui_ in the file name can be seen as _user interaction_

A few major forms of user interfaces of social platforms exist

- The news feed, such as Reddit
  - Interactions are presented in the Tree of comments
  - Threads and comments are separated
- The algorithmically sorted, homogenous posts, Twitter
  - There is no distinction between threads and comments
  - Posts are presented to readers, fairly randomly, as determined by the feed algorithm
- The instant messaging platforms
  - Main objects of interest include, Rooms, Channels, Spaces

Motivation: It's better to design better _modes of interaction_ to optimize user experience and reduce roundtrips.
